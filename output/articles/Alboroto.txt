=====Blooper Real=====
Has anyone noticed how self-conscious today's bloopers have become?  I can't say that they were ever funny, but when an actor forgets his lines and so blurts out anything that comes to mind, there's nothing [[unconscious|Freudian]] about it.<small>'''6 September 2006'''</small>

=====Soap Bar=====
Is anyone else suspicious of the bar of soap, as I am?  Walk into the bathroom and look: it's filthy.  After you wash your hands the first time -- <i>and employees must wash their hands</i> -- it is always necessary to wash them again just to get rid of germs -- <i>left by other employees</i> -- from the soap! That's why I carry my own bar.  Also, a good name for a drinking establishment. <small>1 September 2006</small>
