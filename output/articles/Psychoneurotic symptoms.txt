===Psychoneurotic Symptoms, Formation of===
<blockquote>The theory of the psychoneuroses asserts with absolute certainty that it can only be sexual wish-impulses from the infantile life, which have undergone repression (affect-conversion) during the developmental period of childhood, which are capable of renewal at later periods of development (whether as a result of our sexual constitution, which has, of course, grown out of an original bi-sexuality, or in consequence of unfavorable influences in our sexual life); and which therefore supply the motive-power for all psychoneurotic symptom-formation.<ref>{{IOD}} Ch. 7</ref></blockquote>

===Psychoneurotic Symptoms as Wish-Fulfillments===
<blockquote>The theory of all psychoneurotic symptoms culminates in the one proposition ''that they, too, must be conceived as wish-fulfillments of the unconscious''. (Expressed more exactly: One portion of the symptom correspends to the unconscious wish-fulfillment, while the other corresponds to the reaction-formation opposed to it.)<ref>{{IOD}} Ch. 7</ref></blockquote>
