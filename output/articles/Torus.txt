The [[torus]] is one of the [[:category:figures|figures]] that [[Lacan]] analyzes in his study of [[topology]]. 

==Torus==
In its simplest form, it is a ring, a three-dimensional object formed by taking a cylinder and joining the two ends together.

==Topology==
[[Lacan]]'s first reference to the [[torus]] dates from 1953,<ref>{{E}} p. 105</ref> but it is not until his work on [[topology]] in the 1970s that it begins to figure prominently in his work. 

==Subject==
The [[topology]] of the [[torus]] illustrates certain features of the [[structure]] of the [[subject]]:

One important feature of the [[torus]] is that its center of gravity falls outside its volume, just as the centre of the [[subject]] is outside himself; he is [[decentred]], '''[[extimacy|ex-centric]]'''.

==Extimacy==
Another property of the [[torus]] is that "its peripheral exteriority and its central exteriority constitute only one single region."<ref>{{E}} p. 105</ref>

This illustrates the way that [[psychoanalysis]] problematises the distinction between "[[extimacy|inside]]" and "[[extimacy|outside]]". (see [[extimacy]]).
