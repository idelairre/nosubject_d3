==Definition==
In the [[mirror stage]] the [[infant]] sees its [[reflection]] in the [[mirror]] as  a [[whole]]/[[synthesis]], and this [[perception]] causes, by contrast, the [[perception]] of its own [[body]] (which [[lack]]s [[motor coordination]] at this [[stage]]) as [[division|divided]] and [[fragmentation|fragmented]]. 

==Freudian Dictionary==

<blockquote>I have noticed in the course of my psychoanalytical work that the psychological state of a man in an attitude of reflection is entirely different from that of a man who is observing his psychic processes. In reflection there is a greater play of psychic activity than in the most attentive selfobservation; this is shown even by the tense attitude and the wrinkled brow of the man in a state of reflection, as opposed to the mimic tranquillity of the man observing himself.<ref>{{IoD}} Ch. 2</ref></blockquote>
