=====Description=====
''[[The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis]]'' is the English translation of one of the pivotal works of [[Jacques Lacan]].

Translation of ''Les quatre concepts fondamentaux de la psychanalyse''' by [[Alan Sheridan]].

This classic text probes the relationship between [[psychoanalysis]] and [[science]] and [[religion]] as well as defining the [[unconscious]], the [[repetition]], the [[transference]], and the [[drive]] as the underlying concepts of [[psychoanalysis|psycho-analysis]].


=====Back Cover=====
[[Jacques Lacan]]’s [[Jacques Lacan:Bibliography|writings]], and especially the [[seminars]] for which he has become famous, offer a controversial, radical reappraisal of the legacy bequeathed by [[Freud]]. 

This volume is based on a year’s [[seminar]] in which Dr. [[Lacan]] addressed a larger, less specialized audience than ever before, among whom he could not assume familiarity with his work.

For his listeners then, and for his readers now, he wanted "to introduce a certain coherence into the major concepts on which [[psychoanalysis|psycho-analysis]] is based", namely the ''[[unconscious]]'', ''[[repetition]]'', the ''[[transference]]'' and the ''[[drive]]''.

Along the way he argues for a structural affinity between [[psychoanalysis]] and [[language]], discusses the relation of [[psychoanalysis]] to [[religion]], and reveals his particular stance on topics ranging from [[sexual difference|sexuality]] and [[death]] to [[alienation]] and [[repression]].

This book constitutes the essence of [[Lacan]]'s sensibility.
