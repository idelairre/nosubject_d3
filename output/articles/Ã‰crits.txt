A collection of thirty-five theoretical texts written between 1936 and 1966. Écrits has been characterized as elitist by Jean-Claude Milner, but Slavoj Žižek claims that

<blockquote>In fact, Lacan’s seminars and ecrits relate like analysand’s and analyst’s speech in the treatment. In seminars, Lacan acts as analysand, he “freely associates,” improvises, jumps, addressing his public, which is thus put into the role of a kind of collective analyst. In comparison, his writings are more condensed, formulaic, and they throw at the reader unreadable ambiguous propositions which often appear like oracles, challenging the reader to start working on them, to translate them into clear theses and provide examples and logical demonstrations of them.[http://www.lacan.com/zizhowto.html]</blockquote>
