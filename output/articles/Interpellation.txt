INTERPELLATION
In [[Althusser]]'s theory of [[ideology]], [[interpellation]] is the mechanism that produces [[subject]]s in such a way that they recognize their own [[existence]] in terms of the dominant [[ideology]] of the society in which they live. (1970).

The French ''[[interpellation]]'' is commonly used to mean 'being taken in by the police for questioning', it also means the 'questioning' of a minister in parliament.

[[Althusser]]'s basic illustration of the mechanism exploits this sense of 'questioning' or 'hailing'.

An [[individual]] walking down the street is hailed by a police officer - 'Hey, you there!' - and turns round to recognize the fact that he is being addressed.

In doing so, that [[individual]] is constituted as a [[subject]].

According to [[Althusser]], the idea of interpellation demonstrates that [[subject]]s are always and already the products of [[ideology]], and thus subverts the [[idealist]] thesis that [[subjectivity]] is primary or self-founding.



==Vaneigem==

A similar notion of [[interpellation]] can be found in [[Vaneigem]]'s contribution to the theory of [[situationism]] (1967).

Confronted by the flow of [[sign]]s and [[image]]s that cosntitute [[Debord]]'s '[[society of the spectacle]]', [[individual]]s are constantly [[interpellated]] by posters, advertisements and stereotypes offering universal [[image]]s in which they are invited to recognize themselves.

The function of [[interpellation]] is to block spontaneous creativity.

Whether or not there is any direct connection between the two notions of [[interpellation]] remains unclear.
