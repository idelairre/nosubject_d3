=====Sigmund Freud=====
====="Compulsion to Repeat"=====
For [[Freud]], the "[[repetition|compulsion to repeat]]" -- also referred to as the "[[repetition|repetition compulsion]]" (''[[Wiederholungszwang]]'') -- is related to the '''[[death drive]]''' and the ''[[desire]] to [[return]] to an inorganic state''.

The "[[repetition|compulsion to repeat]]" refers to the tendency of the [[patient]] to expose himself again and again to a distressing or painful situation, although he has [[memory|forgotten]] of [[scene|origins]] of the [[repetition|compulsion]].

[[Psychoanalytic treatment]] involves an effort to break the cycle of [[repetition]] by helping the [[patient]] [[memory|remember]].

=====Jacques Lacan=====
[[Lacan]] expands upon [[Freud]]'s concept of the "[[repetition|compulsion to repeat]]" in various ways.

He borrows the term "'''[[repetition|automatisme de répétition]]'''" ("[[repetition|repetition automatism]]") from [[French]] [[psychiatry]]<ref>[[Lacan]]'s tendency to use "'''[[repetition|automatisme de répétition]]'''" as a translation of [[Freud]]'s ''[[Wiederholungszwang]]'' is a reminder of how much he owes to the [[French]] [[school]] of [[psychiatry]] in which he was first trained.</ref> to refer to the ''[[repetition|compulsive repetition]] or [[repetition|reproduction]] of an [[complex|internalized social structure]] which the [[subject]] '''repeatedly''' and '''compulsively''' re-enacts.''.


While [[Lacan]] never completely abandons the term ''[[repetition|automatisme de répétition]]'', in the 1950s he increasingly uses the term "[[repetition|insistence]]" ([[French]]: ''[[instance]]'') to refer to the [[repetition|repetition compulsion]]. 

[[Lacan]] also defines [[repetition]] as the "'''[[insistence of the letter]]'''" (''[[l'instance de la lettre]]''), that is, as ''the [[repetition|compulsive repetition]] of certain '''[[signifier]]s''' or '''[[letter]]s''' despite the [[subject]]'s [[consciousness|conscious attempts]] to [[repression|repress]] them''.
 
<blockquote>"[[Repetition]] is fundamentally the [[insistence]] of [[speech]]."<ref>{{S3}} p. 242</ref></blockquote>

=====Resistance=====
Certain [[signifier]]s insist on returning in the life of the [[subject]], despite the [[resistance]]s which block them. 

In [[schema L]], [[repetition]] / [[insistence]] is represented by the axis '''A-S''', while the axis '''''a''-''a'''''' represents the [[resistance]] (or "inertia") which opposes [[repetition]].

=====''Jouissance''=====
In the 1960s, [[repetition]] is redefined as the [[return]] of ''[[jouissance]]'', an [[excess]] of [[enjoyment]] which [[return]]s again and again to [[transgress]] the limits of the [[pleasure principle]] and seek [[death]].<ref>{{S17}} p. 51</ref>

=====Transference=====
The [[repetition|compulsion to repeat]] is often [[acting out|acted out]], the [[repetition|repetition compulsion]] manifests itself, in the [[transference]], whereby the [[analysand]] repeats in his relationship to the [[analyst]] certain attitudes which characterised his earlier relationships with his parents and others. 

[[Freud]] establishes an important distinciton between the [[repetition|compulsive repetition]] of material that has not been mastered or understood, and the recollection, verbalization and working-through characteristic of the [[talking cure]].

[[Lacan]] lays great emphasis on this [[symbolic]] aspect of [[transference]], distinguishing it from the [[imaginary]] dimension of [[transference]] (the [[affect]]s of [[love]] and [[hate]]).<ref>{{S8}} p.204</ref> 

However, [[Lacan]] points out that although the [[repetition|repetition compulsion]] manifests itself perhaps most clearly in the [[transference]], it is not in itself limited to the [[transference]]; in itself, "the concept of repetition has nothing to do with the concept of transference."<ref>{{S11}} p. 33</ref>

[[Repetition]] is the general characteristic of the [[signifying chain]], the manifestation of the [[unconscious]] in every [[subject]], and [[transference]] is only a very special form of [[repetition]] (i.e. it is [[repetition]] within [[psychoanalytic treatment]]), which cannot simply be equated with the [[repetition|repetition compulsion]] itself. <ref>{{S8}} p. 208</ref>

<blockquote>It is quite common, for example, to hear it said that the [[transference]] is a form of [[repetition]].  I am not saying that this is untre, or that there is not an element of [[repetition]] in the [[transference]].  I am not saying that it is not on the basis of his experience of the [[transference]] that [[Freud]] approached [[repetition]].  What I am saying is that the concept of [[repetition]] has nothing to do with the concept of [[transference]]. Because of this confusion, I am obliged to go through this explanation at the outset, to lay down the necessary logical steps.  For to follow chronology would be to encourage the ambiguities of the concept of [[repetition]] that derive from the fact that its discovery took place in the course of the first hesistant steps necessitated by the experience of the [[transference]]."<ref>{{S11}} p. 33</ref></blockquote>
