==Paternity and Metaphor==
When, in 1956, [[Lacan]] first begins to discuss the tropes of [[metaphor]] and [[metonymy]] in detail, the example he takes to illustrate the structure of [[metaphor]] is a line from [[Victor Hugo]]'s [[poem]], [[Booz endormi]].<ref>Hugo, 1859-83: 97-9</ref>

This [[poem]] retells the [[biblical]] story of Ruth and Boaz; while Ruth sleeps at his feet, Boaz dreams that a tree grows out of his stomach, a revelation that he is to be the founder of a race. 

In the line which [[Lacan]] quotes - "His sheaf was neither miserly  nor spiteful" - the [[metaphoric]] [[substitution]] of "sheaf" for "Boaz" produces a poetic effect of [[signification]].<ref>{{S3}} p.218-25; {{S4}} p.377-8; {{E}} p.156-8; {{S8}} p.158-9</ref> 

[[Paternity]] is thus both the theme of the [[poem]] (its [[content]]) and also inherent in the [[structure]] of [[metaphor]] itself. 

All [[paternity]] involves [[metaphor]]ic [[substitution]], and vice versa.
