Sigmund Freud defined psychoanalysis as the "science of the unconscious" (''Wissenschaft des Unbewussten''). The use of the German term ''Wissenschaft'' suggests a particular mode of understanding: ''Wissenschaft'' is constituted as a system of knowledge organized into a coherent and ordered arrangement of fundamental concepts (doctrine), capable of accounting for empirically observed phenomena (the objects of possible experiments) by means of a method that ensures their intelligibility and verification through controlled reproduction
