==Jacques Lacan==
===Sigmund Freud===
In the so-called "[[topographical model]]", [[Freud]] isolates [[consciousness]] as one of the parts of the [[psyche]], along with the [[unconscious]] and the [[preconscious]].  [[Lacan]] finds [[Freud]]'s remarks on [[consciousness]] far weaker than his formulations on the [[unconscious]].

<blockquote>"While he [Freud] can give a coherent, balanced account of the majority of other parts of the psychic apparatus, when it's a question of consciousness, he always encounters mutually contradictory conditions."<ref>{{S2}} p.117</ref></blockquote>  According to [[Lacan]], [[Freud]]'s problems with discussing [[consciousness]] return again and again to haunt his [[theory]]: 

<blockquote>"The difficulties which this system of [[consciousness]] raises reappear at each level of [[Freud]]'s theorising."<ref>{{S2}} p.117</ref></blockquote>

===Consciousness and the Ego===
In particular, [[Lacan]] rejects the apparent attempts in [[Freud]]'s work to link the [[consciousness|consciousness-perception system]] to the [[ego]], unless this link is carefully theorized.  If there is a link between the [[ego]] and [[consciousness]], it is in terms of a '''[[lure]]'''. The [[illusion]] of a fully [[mirror|self-transparent]] [[consciousness]] is subverted by the whole [[psychoanalytic]] [[treatment|experience]] (see ''[[cogito]]''). 

<blockquote>"[[Consciousness]] in [[man]] is by essence a polar tension between an [[ego]] alienated from the [[subject]] and a perception which fundamentally escapes it, a pure ''percipi''."<ref>{{S2}} p. 177</ref></blockquote>

===Consciousness and Materialism===
In 1954 [[Lacan]] gives "a [[materialist]] definition of the phenomenon of [[consciousness]]."<ref>{{S2}} p.40-52</ref>  However, [[materialism|matter]] is not to be confused with [[nature]].  [[Lacan]] argues that [[consciousness]] does not evolve from the [[natural]] [[order]].  It is radically discontinuous, and its origin is more akin to [[development|creation]] than to [[development|evolution]].<ref>{{S7}} p. 213-14; 223</ref>

===Subject Supposed to Know===
In the 1960s [[Lacan]] rethinks the [[illusion]] of a [[consciousness|self-consciousness]] (''[[consciousness|Selbstbe-wuﬂtsein]]'') fully [[time|present]] to itself in terms of his concept of the [[subject supposed to know]].
