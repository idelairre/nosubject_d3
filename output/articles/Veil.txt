The problem for [[Lacan]] is how does one [[symbolic]]ally represent '[[lack]]' - something that by definition is not there? 

His solution is the idea of the '[[veil]]'. 

The [[presence]] of the [[veil]] suggests that there is an [[object]] behind it, which the veil covers over, although this is only a presumption on the part of the [[subject]]. 

In this way the [[veil]] enables the perpetuation of the idea that the [[object]] [[exist]]s. 

Thus, both boys and girls can have a relationship to the [[phallus]] on the basis that it always remains veiled and out of reach. 

The [[phallus]] provides the vital link between desire and signification. 

It is desire that drives the process of symbolization. 

The phallus is the ultimate object of desire that we have lost and always search for but never had in the first place.
