==Sigmund Freud==
<!-- =====Definition===== -->
<!-- The [[Oedipus complex]] is a central concept in [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic theory.  is considered by [[Freud]] as one of the "cornerstones" of [[psychoanalysis]].<ref>{{F}} (1923a) "[[Sigmund Freud:Bibliography|Two Encyclopaedia Articles]]", [[SE]], Vol. 18, p. 247.</ref> [[Freud]]'s conception of the [[Oedipus complex]] is probably one of the most popularized and at the same time one of the most misunderstood ideas of [[psychoanalysis]]. -->
The "[[Oedipus complex]]" is a concept used by [[Sigmund Freud]] to refer to the [[unconscious]] [[sexual difference|sexual]] [[desire]] of the [[child]] - especially a [[male]] [[child]] - for the parent of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by hostility and rivalry with the parent of the same sex.
<!-- The [[Oedipus complex]] was defined by [[Freud]] as an [[unconscious]] set of loving and hostile [[desire]]s which the [[subject]] experiences in relation to its parents; the [[subject]] [[desire]]s one parent, and thus enters into rivalry with the other parent. In the "positive" form of the [[Oedipus complex]], the [[desire]]d parent is the parent of the opposite sex to the [[subject]], and the parent of the same sex is the rival. / The "[[Oedipus complex]]" is a term developed by [[Sigmund Freud]] to designate the attraction on the part of the child toward the parent of the opposite sex and rivalry and hostility toward the parent of its own. -->
<!-- The existence of the Oedipus complex explains the [[child]]s sexual attaction towards the parent of the opposite sex and jealously of the parent of the same sex. -->
<!-- It initially refers to the boy's perception of his mother as a sexual object and of his father as a rival, but Freud's description of this 'universal phenomenon' becomes more complicated as he integrates the findings of his studies of the 'sexual theories of children.' -->
<!-- The [[Oedipus complex]] is rather more complicated than this, though, and represents [[Freud]]'s attempt to map the [[ambivalnce|ambivalent]], both [[love|loving]] and hostile, feelings that the [[child]] has towards its parents. In its positive form the complex manifests itself as the desire for the death of a rival, the parent of the same sex, accompanied by the sexual desire for the parent of the opposite sex. In its negative form the complex works in reverse, as the desire for the parent of the same sex and a hatred towards the parent of the opposite sex. In actual fact, a so-called 'normal' Oedipus complex consists of both positive and negative forms. What is important about the Oedipus complex is how the child learns to negotiate and resolve its ambivalent feelings towards its parents. -->

<!-- =====''Oedipus Rex''===== -->
The complex is named after [[Oedipus]], a prominent figure in Greek mythology who unwittingly killed his [[father]] and married his [[mother]].
<!-- The term is named after the [[Oedipus]], a prominent figure in Greek mythology who unwittingly unknowingly killed his father and married his mother. Taking his cue from the ancient Greek tragedy by [[Sophocles]], [[Oedipus Rex]], where [[Oedipus]] unwittingly kills his [[father]] and becomes king by marrying his [[mother]], [[Freud]] suggested that our deepest [[unconscious]] [[desire]] is to murder our [[father]] and marry our [[mother]]. -->
<!-- One of the cornerstones of the theory of [[psychoanalysis]], the idea of the [[Oedipus complex]] derives from the Greek legend that tells how [[Oedipus]] unwittingly killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta.  When he finally learns what he has done, he blinds himself./ It comes from the Greek myth of Oedipus, a Greek hero who unknowingly killed his father and married his mother.  /  The term derives from ''[[Oedipus]]'' was a prominent figure in Greek mythology who killed his father and married his mother. / [[Freud]] attributes the "gripping power" of [[Sophocles]]' play, ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' to its depiction of what [[Freud]] considers a "universal event in early childhood." -->
<!-- Followers of the psychologist Sigmund Freud long believed that the Oedipus complex was common to all cultures, although many psychiatrists now refute this belief. -->
<!-- =====History===== -->
<!-- References to the [[Oedipus complex]] can be foudn in some of [[Freud]]'s earliest writings./ Although the term does not appear in [[Freud]]'s writings until 1910, traces of its origins can be found much earlier in his work, and by 1910 it was already showing signs of the central importance that it was to acquire in all [[psychoanalytic theory]] thereafter.  -->
<!-- The "[[Oedipus complex]]" is first introduced by [[Freud]] in 1901; it comes to acquire central importance in [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic theory]] thereafter. -->
<!-- The "[[Oedipus complex]]" was posited by [[Sigmund Freud]] as the central organizing principle of psychosexual development. crucial stage in the normal developmental process. -->
<!-- Although the [[Oedipus complex]] is absolutely central to Freud's theory of human development, no one paper is devoted to it. -->

===Phallic Phase===
The [[Oedipus complex]] emerges in the third year of life and then declines in the fifth year, and coincides with the [[phallic stage]] of [[development|psychosexual development]].
<!-- The Oedipus conflict, or Oedipus complex, was described as a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occurring around the age of 5 and a half years (a period known as the phallic stage in Freudian theory). -->
<!-- It occurs during the phallic stage of the psycho-sexual development of the personality, approximately years three to five. The [[Oedipus complex]] emerges in the third year of life and then declines in the fifth year when the [[child]] [[renunciation|renounces]] [[desire|sexual desire]] for its parents and [[identification|identifies]] with the rival. -->
<!-- during which the primary erogenous zone of the body consists of the genital sex organs. when awareness of and manipulation of the genitals is supposed to be a primary source of pleasure/ during which a child becomes interested in his or her own sexual organs --
<!-- Freud came to assume that, by the time he has reached the ‘phallic’ stage of development, at around the age of four or five, the small boy is sexually interested in his mother, wishes to gain exclusive possession of her, and therefore harbours hostile impulses towards his father. -->
<!-- Freudians normally date the [[Oedipus complex]] to the ages of three to five years; according to [[Klein]], it occurs much earlier. -->
<!-- Freud saw this process as taking place between the ages of three and five years. With the resolution of the Oedipus complex sexuality goes through a period of 'latency' until it reappears during puberty as adolescent sexuality. -->
<!-- Most controversially, Freud insisted that the Oedipus complex was a universal, trans-historical and trans-cultural phenomenon: <blockquote>[T]he Oedipus complex is the nuclear complex of neuroses, and constitutes the essential part of their content. It represents the peak of infantile sexuality, which, through its after-effects, exercises a decisive influence on the sexuality of adults. Every new arrival on this planet is faced by the task of mastering the Oedipus complex; anyone who fails to do so falls a victim to neurosis.<ref>Freud 1991d [1905]: 149</ref></blockquote> -->

<!--
=====Castration Complex=====
The hostility towards the father arouses the fear that the father will remove the offending sex organ of the boy, called [[castration anxiety]]. The [[castration complex]] arises from the  boy's assumption that, because girls are without a penis, they must have suffered castration.  The reality of castration is borught home to the boy when he sees the sexual anatomy of the girl, which is lacking the protruding genitals of the male. The girl appears castrated to the boy. "If that could happen to her, it could also happen to me," is what he thinks. As a result of castration anxiety, the boy represses his incestuous desire for the mother an his hostility for the father, and the Oedipus complex disappears.
-->
<!-- the fact that a girl does not hav emale genitals is therefore the result of her castration, -->

==Jacques Lacan==
<!--
In Lacanian terms, the [[Oedipus complex]] marks the transition from a dual and potentially incestuous relationship with the mother to a triadic relationship in which the role and authority of the father or the [[Name-of-the-Father]] are recognized. Although Lacan follows Freud in making the [[Oedipus complex]] the crucial moment in human development, he modifies the concept in a number of ways, both by introducing the idea of a symbolic phallic which is distinct from the biological penis, and by mapping it onto the transition from nature to culture described by [[Levi-Strauss]].  A succesful negotiation of the Oedipal triangle is a precondition for entry into the human symbolic order.
-->
<!--
===Family Complexes===
[[Lacan]] first addresses the [[Oedipus complex]] in his [[{{Y}}|1938]] article on the [[family complexes|family]], where he argues that it is the last and most important of the three "family complexes." At this point his account of the [[Oedipus complex]] does not differ from [[Freud]]'s, his only originality being to emphasize its historical and cultural relativity, taking his cue from the anthropological studies by Malinowski and others.<ref>{{L}} 1938: 66</ref>  It is in the 1950s that [[Lacan]] begins to develop his own distinctive conception of the [[Oedipus complex]]. Though he always follows [[Freud]] in regarding the [[Oedipus complex]] as the central complex in the [[unconscious]], he now begins to differ from [[Freud]] on a number of important points. 

The most important of these is that in [[Lacan]]'s view, the [[subject]] always desires the [[mother]], and the [[father]] is always the rival, irrespective of whether the [[subject]] is [[male]] or [[female]]. Consequently, in [[Lacan]]'s account the [[male]] [[subject]] experiences the [[Oedipus complex]] in a radically asymmetrical way to the [[female]] [[subject]]. 
-->
<!-- In an early encyclopaedia article on the family (1938) [[Lacan]] adopted a fairly orthodox Freudian understanding of the Oedipus complex, and it was not until the 1950s and through the influence of Lévi-Strauss that Lacan began to develop his own distinctive 'structural' model of the [[complex]]. For [[Lacan]], the [[Oedipus complex]] is primarily a symbolic structure. When two people live together or get married they  do so forvery personal and intimate reasons, but at the same time there is a wider social or symbolic aspect to this relationship. A relationship or marriage concerns not just the two people involved but also a whole social network of friends, relations and institutions. Thus, personal relationships situate men and women in a symbolic circuit of social meanings. According to [[Lacan]], therefore, we must distinguish between the real people involved and the symbolic structures that organize relationships between men and women. In our society the primary structure that defines our symbolic and unconscious relations is the Oedipus complex. More precisely the [[Oedipus complex]] represents a triangular structure that breaks the binary relationship established between the [[mother]] and [[child]] in the imaginary, although, as we will see, the imaginary is never simply a dual structure - there is always a third element involved. The infant's earliest experiences are characterized by absolute dependence upon the mother as she fulfils the child's needs of feeding, caring and nurturing. At the same time the child is faced with the enigma around the (m)other's desire - What am I in the Other's desire? The answers the child comes up with will be crucial to its resolution of the [[Oedipus complex]]. -->
===Symbolic Structure===
The [[Oedipus complex]] is, for [[Lacan]], the paradigmatic triangular [[structure]], which contrasts with all [[dual relation]]s (though see the final paragraph below). The key function in the [[Oedipus complex]] is thus that of the [[father]], the third term which transforms the [[dual relation]] between [[mother]] and [[child]] into a [[triad]]ic [[structure]]. The [[Oedipus complex]] is thus nothing less than the passage from the [[imaginary]] [[order]] to the [[symbolic order]], "the conquest of the symbolic relation as such."<ref>{{S3}} p.199</ref> The fact that the passage to the [[symbolic]] passes via a complex sexual [[dialectic]] means that the [[subject]] cannot have access to the [[symbolic order]] without confronting the problem of [[sexual difference]]. 

===Times===
In ''[[Seminar|The Seminar, Book V]]'', [[Lacan]] analyzes this passage from the [[imaginary]] to the [[symbolic]] by [[identification|identifying]] three "times" of the [[Oedipus complex]], the sequence being one of logical rather than chronological priority.<ref>{{L}} 1957-8: [[seminar]] of 22 January 1958</ref>
<!-- The first time of the [[Oedipus complex]] is characterized by the [[imaginary]] [[triangle]] of [[mother]], [[child]] and [[phallus]]. prior to the invention of the [[father]] there is never a purely [[dual relation]] between the [[mother]] and the [[child]] but always a third term, the [[phallus]], an [[imaginary]] [[object]] which the [[mother]] [[desire]]s beyond the [[child]] himself (S4, 240-1). [[Lacan]] hints that the presence of the [[imaginary]] [[phallus]] as a third term in the [[imaginary]] [[triangle]] -->
<!-- In the previous [[seminar]] of 1956-7, [[Lacan]] calls this the [[preoedipal]] [[triangle]]. However, whether this [[triangle]] is regarded as [[preoedipal]] or as a moment in the [[Oedipus complex]] itself, the main point is the same: namely, that prior to the invention of the [[father]] there is never a purely [[dual relation]] between the [[mother]] and the [[child]] but always a third term, the [[phallus]], an [[imaginary]] [[object]] which the [[mother]] [[desire]]s beyond the [[child]] himself (S4, 240-1). [[Lacan]] hints that the presence of the [[imaginary]] [[phallus]] as a third term in the [[imaginary]] [[triangle]] indicates that the [[symbolic]] [[father]] is already functioning at this time.<ref>{{L}} 1957-8: [[seminar]] of 22 January 1958</ref> -->

====First====
<!--
The [[mother]] provides the necessary care, feeding and satisfaction of [[need]]s, while there is within her the [[desire]] for something other than [[satisfaction|satisfying]] the [[infant]]'s [[desire]].  The [[mother]] [[lack]]s the [[phallus]] and [[desire]]s in the [[infant]] something other than himself - the [[phallus]] she [[lack]]s (the basis of the relationship with her [[father]], and of her own [[Oedipus complex]]).  The [[mother]] [[desire]]s something apart from attending to the [[child]]'s [[need]]s and cares, for behind her there is the [[Symbolic]] [[Order]] on which she depends, and also the [[phallus]], which plays the prominent role in the [[Symbolic]] [[Order]].  The [[infant]] is then caught in an imaginary relationship with the mother, familiar from the mirror stage, only this time centered on the [[presence]] and [[absence]] of the [[phallus]].

The [[infant]] takes up a particular attitude with respect to the mother and the phallus.  In the first time of the [[Oedipus complex]], the [[child]] tries to [[identification|identify]] with the [[mother]]'s [[object]] of [[desire]], the [[phallus]]. (his desire is the desire of the Other)
-->
In the first time of the [[Oedipus complex]], the [[child]] slowly comes to realize that it is not identical to, or the sole object of, the [[mother]]'s [[desire]], as her [[desire]] is directed elsewhere.  He or she will therefore attempt to [[satisfy]] her [[desire]] by becoming the [[object]] of her [[desire]].  The [[dual relation|dyadic relationship]] between the [[mother]] and [[child]] is thus turned into a triangular relationship between the [[child]], the [[mother]] and the [[object]] of her [[desire]]. Lacan calls this third term the [[imaginary phallus]]. The [[imaginary]] [[phallus]] is what the [[child]] assumes someone must have in order for them to be the [[object]] of the [[mother]]'s [[desire]] and, as her [[desire]] is usually directed towards the [[father]], it is assumed that he possesses the [[phallus]]. Through trying to satisfy the [[mother]]'s [[desire]], the [[child]] identifies with the object that it presumes she has lost and attempts to become that [[object]] for her.
<!--
((In the first time of the [[Oedipus complex]], then, the [[child]] realizes that both he and the [[mother]] are marked by a [[lack]].  The [[mother]] is marked by [[lack]], since she is seen to be [[lack|incomplete]]; otherwise, she would not [[desire]]. The [[lack]]ing element is the [[imaginary]] [[phallus]].  ))
The [[mother]] [[desire]]s the [[phallus]] she [[lack]]s, and (in conformity with [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[desire]]) the [[subject]] seeks to become the [[object]] of her [[desire]]; he seeks to be the [[phallus]] for the [[mother]] and fill out her [[lack]]. The [[child]] seeks to [[identification|identify]] with what he or she supposes to be the [[object]] of her [[desire]], with the object that the mother supposedly lacks, the object that is capable of filling in the lack in the other is the phallus. 
<blockquote>What the child wants is to become the desire of desire, to be able to satisfy the mother's desire, that is, "to be or not to be" the object of the mother's desire.... To please the mother ...it is necessary and sufficient to be the phallus.  7  [ Lacan 1957-1958, seminar of January 22, 1958 ]</blockquote>
-->
<!-- At this point, the [[mother]] is omnipotent and her [[desire]] is the [[law]].  Although this omnipotence may be seen as threatening from the very beginning, the sense of threat is intensified when the [[child]]'s own sexual [[drive]]s begin to manifest themselves (for example in infantile masturba­tion).  This emergence of the [[real]] of the [[drive]] introduces a discordant note of [[anxiety]] into the previously seductive [[imaginary]] [[triangle]].<ref>{{S4}} p. 225-6</ref> The [[child]] is now confronted with the realization that he cannot simply fool the [[mother]]'s [[desire]] with the [[imaginary]] [[semblance]] of a [[phallus]] - he must present something in the [[real]].  Yet the [[child]]'s real organ (whether boy or girl) is hopelessly inadequate.  This sense of inadequacy and impotence in the face of an omnipotent [[mother|maternal]] [[desire]] that cannot be placated gives rise to [[anxiety]].  Only the intervention of the [[father]] in the subsequent times of the [[Oedipus complex]] can provide a real solution to this [[anxiety]]. -->

====Second====
The second time of the [[Oedipus complex]] is characterized by the interven­tion of the [[imaginary]] [[father]]. The [[father]] imposes the [[law]] on the [[mother]]'s [[desire]] by denying her access to the [[phallic]] [[object]] and [[prohibition|forbidding]] the [[subject]] access to the [[mother]].  [[Lacan]] often refers to this intervention as the "[[castration]]" of the [[mother]], even though he states that, properly speaking, the operation is not one of [[castration]] but of [[privation]].  
<!-- This intervention is mediated by the [[discourse]] of the [[mother]]; in other words, what is important is not that the [[real]] [[father]] step in and impose the [[law]], but that this [[law]] be respected by the [[mother]] herself in both her words and her actions.  The [[subject]] now sees the [[father]] as a rival for the [[mother]]'s [[desire]]. -->
<!-- In this second position, the father intervenes, either directly or through the mother's discourse, as the omnipotent and prohibiting figure, putting in question and forbidding the desire of the mother (le désir de la Mère), laying down the law and permitting identification with him as the one who has the phallus.  ((He says, as it were, to the child, "no you won't sleep with your mother"; and to the mother, "No, the child is not your phallus. I have it." -->

====Third====
The third 'time' of the [[Oedipus complex]] is marked by the intervention of the [[real]] [[father]]. 
<!--
The father appear as the one who reinstates the phallus as the desired object of the mother, rather than as the terrifying, castrating, omnipotent father who can deprive her.
-->
By showing that he has the [[phallus]], and neither exchanges it nor gives it,<ref>{{S3}} p. 319</ref>, the [[real]] [[father]] [[castration|castrates]] the [[child]], in the sense of making it impossible for the [[child]] to persist in trying to be the [[phallus]] for the [[mother]]; it is no use competing with the [[real]] [[father]], because he always wins.<ref>{{S4}} pp. 208-9, 227</ref>  The [[subject]] is freed from the impossible and [[anxiety]]-­provoking task of having to be the [[phallus]] by realizing that the [[father]] has it.  This allows the [[subject]] to [[identify]] with the [[father]].  
<!--In this secondary ([[symbolic]]) [[identification]] the [[subject]] transcends the [[aggressivity]] inherent in primary ([[imaginary]]) [[identification]]. -->
[[Lacan]] follows [[Freud]] in arguing that the [[superego]] is formed out of this [[Oedipal]] [[identification]] with the [[father]].<ref>{{S4}} p. 415</ref> 
<!-- The [[Oedipus complex]] marks the transition from the [[imaginary]] to the [[symbolic]]. Through the intervention of a third term, the [[Name-of-the-Father]], that closed circuit of mutual desire between the [[mother]] and [[child]] is broken and a space is created, within which the [[child]] can begin to identify itself as a separate being from the [[mother]]. [[Lacan]] calls this third term the [[Name-of-the-Father]], because it does not have to be the real father, or even a male figure, but is a symbolic position that the child perceives to be the location of the object of the [[mother]]'s [[desire]]. It is also, as we will see, a position of authority and the [[symbolic]] [[law]] that intervenes to prohibit the [[child]]'s [[desire]]. For [[Lacan]], the key signifier that this whole process turns upon is the [[phallus]]. -->
<!--
==Structure==
Since the [[symbolic]] is the realm of the [[law]], and since the [[Oedipus complex]] is the conquest of the [[symbolic order]], it has a normative and normalizing function.  "The Oedipus complex is essential for the human being to be able to accede to a humanized structure of the real."<ref>{{S3}} p.198</ref> This normative function is to be understood in reference to both [[clinic]]al [[structure]]s and the question of [[sexuality]]. 
-->
<!--
===Psychopathology===
[[Freud]] argued that all psychopathological [[structure]]s could be traced to a malfunction in the [[Oedipus complex]], which was thus dubbed "the nuclear complex of the neuroses". 
-->

=====Clinical Structures=====
In accordance with [[Freud]]'s view of the [[Oedipus complex]] as the root of all psychopathology, [[Lacan]] relates all the [[clinic]]al [[structure]]s to difficulties in this [[complex]].  Since it is impossible to resolve the [[complex]] completely, a completely non-pathological position does not [[exist]].  The closest thing is a [[neurotic]] [[structure]]; the [[neurotic]] has come through all three times of the [[Oedipus complex]], and there is no such thing as a [[neurosis without [[Oedipus]]. On the other hand, [[psychosis]], [[perversion]] and [[phobia]] result when "something is essentially incomplete in the Oedipus complex."<ref>{{S2}} p.201</ref> In [[psychosis]], there is a fundamental blockage even before the first time of the [[Oedipus complex]]. 
In [[perversion]], the [[complex]] is carried through to the third time, but instead of [[identifying]] with the [[father]], the [[subject]] [[identifies]] with the [[mother]] and/or the [[imaginary]] [[phallus]], thus harking back to the [[imaginary]] [[preoedipal]] [[triangle]]. 
A [[phobia]] arises when the [[subject]] cannot make the transition from the second time of the [[Oedipus complex]] to the third time because the [[real]] [[father]] does not intervene; the [[phobia]] then functions as a substitute for the intervention of the [[real]] [[father]], thus permitting the [[subject]] to make the passage to the third time of the [[Oedipus complex]] (though often in an atypical way). 
<!-- 
=====Psychopathology===== 
Failure to negotiate this transition is held by all schools of psychoanalysis to be the primary cause of [neurosis]].

The Oedipus complex or conflict is a concept developed by Sigmund Freud to explain the origin of certain neuroses in childhood [[Freud]] argued that all psychopathological [[structure]]s could be traced to a malfunction in the [[Oedipus complex]], which was thus dubbed "the nuclear complex of the neuroses". The Oedipus complex is closely connected to the castration complex. Resolution of the Oedipus complex is believed to occur by identification with the parent of the same sex and by the renunciation of sexual interest in the parent of the opposite sex. Freud considered this complex the cornerstone of the superego and the nucleus of all human relationships. 
-->
<!--
=====The Oedipus complex and sexuality=====
It is the particular way the [[subject]] navigates his passage through the [[Oedipus complex]] that determines both his assumption of a sexual position and his choice of a sexual object (on the question of object choice<ref>{{S4}} p.201</ref>). 
-->

<!--
In his [[seminar]] of 1969-70, [[Lacan]] re-examines the [[Oedipus complex]], and analyzes the [[myth]] of [[Oedipus]] as one of [[Freud]]'s [[dream]]s.<ref>{{S17}} Ch. 8</ref> In this [[seminar]] (though not for the first time<ref>{{S7}}</ref>) [[Lacan]] compares the [[myth]] of [[Oedipus]] with the other [[Freud]]ian [[myth]]s (the [[myth]] of the [[father]] of the horde in ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'', and the [[myth]] of the murder of Moses<ref>{{F}} 1912-13; 1939a</ref>) and argues that the [[myth]] of ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' is structurally opposite to the [[myth]] of [[Oedipus]].  In the [[myth]] of [[Oedipus]], the murder of the [[father]] allows [[Oedipus]] to enjoy sexual relations with his [[mother]], whereas in the [[myth]] of ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' the murder of the [[father]], far from allowing access to the [[father]]'s [[women]], only reinforces the [[Law]] which forbids [[incest]].<ref>{{S7}} p. 176</ref>  [[Lacan]] argues that in this respect the [[myth]] of ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' is more accurate than the [[myth]] of [[Oedipus]]; the former shows that [[enjoyment]] of the [[mother ]]is impossible, whereas the latter presents [[enjoyment]] of the [[mother]] as forbidden but not impossible.  In the [[Oedipus complex]] a [[prohibition]] of ''[[jouissance]]'' thus serves to hide the impossibility of this ''[[jouissance]]''; the [[subject]] can thus persist in the [[neurotic]] [[illusion]] that, were it not for the [[Law]] which forbids it, ''[[jouissance]]'' would be possible. 
-->
<!--
In his reference to fourfold models, [[Lacan]] makes an implicit criticism of all triangular models of the [[Oedipus complex]]. (** Thus, though the [[Oedipus complex]] can be seen as the transition from a [[dual relation]]ship to a [[triangular]] [[structure]], [[Lacan]] argues that it is more accurately represented as the transition from a [[preoedipal]] [[triangle]] ([[mother]]-[[child]]-[[phallus]]) to an [[Oedipal]] [[quaternary]] ([[mother]]-[[child]]-[[father]]-[[phallus]]). **) Another possibility is to see the [[Oedipus complex]] as a transition from the [[preoedipal]] [[triangle]] ([[mother]]-[[child]]-[[phallus]]) to the [[Oedipal]] [[triangle]] ([[mother]]-[[child]]-[[father]]).
