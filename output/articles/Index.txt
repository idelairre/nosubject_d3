==Charles Peirce==
==Sign==
In the typology of [[sign]]s devised by Charles S. Peirce, the North American semiotician, the [[index]] is a [[sign]] whih has an "existential relationship" to the [[object]] it represents (i.e. the [[index]] is always spatially or temporally contiguous with the [[object]]).

==Symbol==
Peirce contrasts the [[index]] swith the [[symbol]], which, like [[Saussure]]'s concept of the [[sign]], is characterized by the [[absence]] of all necessary connections between the [[sign]] and its [[object]].

For example, smoke is an [[index]] of fire.

==Signifier==
In [[Lacan]]'s [[discourse]], the term "[[index]]" functions in opposition to the term [[signifier]].

[[Lacan]] thus conceives the [[index]] as a "[[nature|natural]]" [[sign]], one in which there is a fixed, bi-univocal correspondence between [[sign]] and [[object]] (unlike the [[signifier]], which has no fixed link with any one [[signified]]).

This opposition between [[index]] and [[signifier]] underpins the following distinctions in [[Lacan]]'s work.

===The Psychoanalytic and Medical Concepts of the Symptom===
Whereas in medicine, the [[symptom]] is regarded as an [[index]] of the disease, in [[psychoanalysis]] the [[symptom]] is not an [[index]] but a [[signifier]].<ref>{{E}} p. 129</ref>

Hence in [[psychoanalysis]] there is no one-to-one fixed link between pathological phenomena and the underlying [[structure]].

===Codes (Animal) and Language (Human)===
[[Code]]s are composed of [[index|indices]], whereas [[language]] is composed of [[signifier]]s.

This explains why [[code]]s lack the most important feature of [[language]]: its potential for ambiguity and equivocation.

The opposition between [[signifier]] and [[index]] is complicated by the [[existence]] of certain [[signifier]]s which also function as [[index|indices]]; these are called [[shifter]]s.
