==Philosophy==
The term "[[dialectic]]" originated with the Greeks, for whom it denoted (among other things) a discursive procedure in which an opponent in a debate is questioned in such a way as to bring out the contradictions in his [[discourse]]. 

This is the tactic which [[Plato]] ascribes to [[Socrates]], who is shown as beginning most dialogues by first reducing his interlocutor to a state of confusion and [[helplessness]]. 

==Psychoanalytic Treatment==
[[Lacan]] compares this to the first stage of [[psychoanalytic treatment]], when the [[analyst]] forces the [[analysand]] to confront the contradictions and [[gap]]s in his narrative. 

However, just as [[Socrates]] then proceeds to draw out the [[truth]] from the confused statements of his interlocutor, so also the [[analyst]] proceeds to draw out the [[truth]] from the [[analysand]]'s [[free association]]s.<ref>{{S8}} p. 140</ref> 

Thus [[Lacan]] argues that "psychoanalysis is a dialectical experience"<ref>{{Ec}} p. 216</ref>, since the analyst must engage the analysand in 'a dialectical operation."<ref>{{S1}} p. 278</ref> 

It is only by means of "an endless dialectical process" that the [[analyst]] can subvert the [[ego]]'s disabling [[illusion]]s of permanence and stability, in a manner identical to the Socratic Dialogue.<ref>{{L}} "[[Works of Jacques Lacan|Some Reflections on the Ego]]," ''Int. J. Psycho-Anal.'', vol. 34, 1953 [1951b]. p. 12</ref>

==Hegelian Dialectic==
Although the origin of [[dialectic]]s goes back to the Greek philosophers, its dominance in modern philosophy is due to the revival of the concept in the eighteenth century by the [[Kant|post-Kantian]] [[idealism|idealists]] Fichte and [[Hegel]], who conceived of the [[dialectic]] as a [[triad]] of [[dialectic|thesis]], [[dialectic|antithesis]] and [[dialectic|synthesis]]. 

For [[Hegel]], the [[dialectic]] is both a method of exposition and the [[structure]] of historical progress itself. 

Thus in ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), [[Hegel]] shows how [[consciousness]] [[progress]]es towards [[dialectic|absolute knowledge]] by means of a series of confrontations between opposing elements. 

Each confrontation is resolved by an operation called the ''[[Aufhebung]]'' (usually translated as "[[sublation]]") in which a new idea (the [[dialectic|synthesis]]) is born from the opposition between [[dialectic|thesis]] and [[dialectic|antithesis]]; the [[dialectic|synthesis]] simultaneously annuls, preserves and raises this opposition to a higher level.

==Alexandre Kojève==
The particular way in which the [[Hegelian]] [[dialectic]] is appropriated by [[Lacan]] owes much to [[Alexandre Kojève]], whose lectures on [[Hegel]] [[Lacan]] attended in Paris in the 1930s.

Following [[Kojève]] [[Lacan]] puts great emphasis on the particular stage of the [[dialectic]] in which the [[master]] confronts the [[slave]], and on the way that [[desire]] is constituted [[dialectically]] by a relationship with the [[desire]] of the [[Other]]. 

==Progression Toward Truth==
Using the [[Dora]] case to illustrate his point, [[Lacan]] shows how [[psychoanalytic treatment]] [[progress]]es towards [[truth]] by a series of [[dialectical]] reversals.<ref>{{L}} "[[Works of Jacques Lacan|Intervention sur le transfert]]", in {{Ec}} pp. 215-26 ["[[Works of Jacques Lacan|Intervention on the Transference]]", trans. Jacqueline Rose, in Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline Rose (eds), ''Feminine Sexuality: Jacques Lacan and the École Freudienne'', London: Macmillan, 1982 [1951a]. pp. 61-73</ref>

==''Aufhebung''==
[[Lacan]] also makes use of a concept of ''[[Aufhebung]]'' to show how the [[symbolic]] [[order]] can simultaneously annul, preserve and raise an [[imaginary]] [[object]] (the [[imaginary]] [[phallus]]) to the status of a [[signifier]] (the [[symbolic]] [[phallus]]); the [[phallus]] then becomes "the signifier of this ''[[Aufhebung]]'' itself, which it inaugurates by its disappearance."<ref>{{E}} p. 288</ref>

==Lacanian Dialectic==
However, there are also important differences between the [[Lacanian]] [[dialectic]], and the [[Hegelian]] [[dialectic]].

For [[Lacan]], there is no such thing as a final [[dialectic|synthesis]] such as is represented by Hegel's concept of [[dialectic|absolute knowledge]]; the irreducibility of the [[unconscious]] represents the impossibility of any such [[dialectic|absolute knowledge]].

For [[Lacan]], then, "the ''[[Aufhebung]]'' is one of those sweet dreams of [[philosophy]]."<ref>{{S20}} p. 79</ref>

This [[disavowal|denial]] of a final [[dialectic|synthesis]] subverts the very concept of [[progress]] itself.

Thus [[Lacan]] contrasts his own version of the ''[[Aufhebung]]'' with that of [[Hegel]], arguing that it repalces [[Hegel]]'s idea of [[progress]] with"the avatars of a lack."<ref>{{Ec}} p. 837</ref>
