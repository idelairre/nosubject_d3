In [[Freud]]'s work, the term '[[affect]]' stands in opposition to the term '[[idea]]'. 

The opposition between the affective and the intellectual is one of the oldest themes in [[philosophy]], and made its way into [[Freud]]'s vocabulary via [[German]] [[psychology]].

For [[Lacan]], however, the opposition between the [[affective]] and the [[intellectual]] is not valid in the psychoanalytic field. 

'This opposition is one of the most contrary to analytic experience and most unenlightening when it comes to understanding it' (Sl, 274).

Thus, in response to those who accuse [[Lacan]] of being over-[[intellectual]] and of neglecting the role of [[affect]], it can be pointed out that this [[criticism]] is based on what [[Lacan]] saw as a false opposition.

([[Lacan]] also argued that criticisms of being over-intellectual were often merely excuses for sloppy thinking.<ref>{{E}} p.171</ref>

[[Psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]] is based on the [[symbolic]] [[order]], which transcends the opposition between [[affect]] and [[intellect]]. 

On the one hand, [[psychoanalytic]] experience 'is not that of an affective smoochy-woochy' (Sl, 55). 

On the other hand, nor is [[psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]] an intellectual affair; 'we are not dealing here with an intellectual dimension' (Sl, 274). 

The [[Lacan]]ian [[psychoanalyst]] must thus be aware of the ways in which both 'affective smoochy-woochy' and intellectualisation can be [[resistance]]s to [[analysis]], [[imaginary]] [[lure]]s of the [[ego]]. 

[[Anxiety]] is the only [[affect]] that is not deceptive.

[[Lacan]] is opposed to those [[analyst]]s who have taken the [[affect]]ive realm as primary, for the [[affect]]ive is not a separate realm opposed to the [[intellectual]].

'The affective is not like a special density which would escape an intellectual accounting. It is not to be found in a mythical beyond of the production of the symbol which would precede the discursive formulation.'<ref>Sl, 57</ref>

However, he rejects accusations of neglecting the role of [[affect]], pointing to the fact that a whole year of the [[seminar]] is dedicated precisely to discussing [[anxiety]] (Lacan, 1973a: 38).

[[Lacan]] does not propose a general theory of affects, but only touches on them insofar as they impinge on psychoanalytic treatment. 

He insists on the relationship of [[affect]] to the [[symbolic]] [[order]]; [[affect]] means that the [[subject]] is affected by his relation with the [[Other]]. 

He argues that [[affect]]s are not [[signifier]]s but [[signal]]s (S7, 102-3), and emphasises [[Freud]]'s position that [[repression]] does not bear upon the [[affect]] (which can only be transformed or [[displacement|displaced]]) but upon the ideational representative (which is, in [[Lacan]]'s terms, the [[signifier]]) (Ec, 714).

[[Lacan]]'s comments on the concept of [[affect]] have important implications in [[clinical]] [[practice]]. 

Firstly, all the concepts in [[psychoanalysis]] which have traditionally been conceived in terms of [[affect]]s, such as the [[transference]], must be rethought in terms of their [[symbolic]] [[structure]], if the [[analyst]] is to direct the [[treatment]] correctly.

Secondly, the [[affect]]s are [[lure]]s which can deceive the [[analyst]], and hence the [[analyst]] must be wary of being tricked by his own [[affect]]s. 

This does not mean that the [[analyst]] must disregard his own feelings for the [[patient]], but simply that he must know how to make adequate use of them.

Finally, it follows that the aim of [[psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]] is not the reliving of [[past]] experiences, nor the [[abreaction]] of [[affect]], but the articulation in [[speech]] of the [[truth]] about [[desire]].

Another term in [[Lacan]]'s [[discourse]], related to but distinct from '[[affect]]', is the term '[[passion]]'. 

[[Lacan]] speaks of the 'three fundamental passions': [[love]], [[hate]] and [[ignorance]] (Sl, 271); this is a reference to [[Buddhist]] thought (E, 94).

These [[passion]]s are not [[imaginary]] phenomena, but located at the junctions between the three [[order]]s.

AFFECT
word borrowed from the [[German]] ''Affekt''.  

In nineteenth-century [[psychology]] the term is synonymous with [[emotion]] or [[excitement]].  

Borrowing from that tradition, [[psychoanalysis]] defines [[afect]] as a quantity of [[psychic]] [[energy]] or a sum of [[excitation]] accompanying events that take place in the [[life]] of the [[psyche]].  

[[Affect]] is not a direct [[emotion]]al [[representation]] of an [[event]], but a [[trace]] or residue that is aroused or reactivated through the [[repetition]] of that [[event]] of by some equivalent to it.  

Like [[libido]], [[affect]] is quantifiable and both [[drives]] and [[image]]s are therefore said to have a quota of affect.

In [[Freud]]'s earliest theory of [[hysteria]] (the so-called [[seduction thoery]]), the blocking of the [[affect]] correspodning to a [[trauma]]tic [[event]] has a causal role; because it cannot be expressed or discharged in [[word]]s, it takes the form of a [[somatic]] [[symptom]].  

In his later writings [[Freud]] consistently makes a distinction between [[affect]] and [[representation]]s, which may be either [[verbal]] or [[visual]].  

The [[verbalization]] of the [[talking cure]] thus becomes an intellectualized way of [[discharging]] [[affect]]s relating to [[childhood]] [[experience]]s.

One of the [[criticism]]s levelled at [[Lacan]] by certain of his fellow [[psychoanalyst]]s is that he tends to pay little attention to [[affect]].
