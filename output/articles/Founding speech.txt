==Jacques Lacan==
The term "[[founding speech]]" -- sometimes rendered "[[founding speech|foundational speech]]" -- emerges in Lacan's work at the time of his growing attention to [[language]] in the early 1950s.<ref>{{L}}. "[[Works of Jacques Lacan|Fonction et champ de la parole et du langage en psychanalyse]].''" 1953a. In {{Ec}} p. 237-322. ("[[The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis|The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis]].")  In {{E}}. p. 30-113</ref>

==Transformation==
The point [[Lacan]] draws attention to in his use of this term is the way that [[speech]] can radically transform both the speaker and the addressee in the act of utterance.  [[Lacan]]'s two favorate examples of this are the phrases "You are my master/teacher (''maître'')" and "You are my wife," which serve to position the speaker as "pupil' and "husband" respectively.  In order words, the crucial aspect of [[founding speech]] is that it not only transforms the [[other]] but also transforms the [[subject]].<ref>{{E}} p. 85</ref>

<blockquote>"Founding speech, which envelops the subject, is everything that has constituted him, his parents, his neighbours, the whole structure of his community, and not only constituted him as symboli (?), but constituted him in his being."<ref>{{S2}} p.20</ref></blockquote>

==Elective and Votive Speech==
[[Lacan]] refers to the same function of [[speech]] as "elective speech" in the [[seminar]] of 1955-6 and as "votive speech" in the [[seminar]] of 1956-7.  [[Lacan]] plays on the homophony between ''tu es ma mère'' ("you are my mother") and ''tuer ma mère'' ("to kill my mother") to illustrate the way that the [[founding speech]] addressed to the other may reveal a [[repression|repressed]] murderous [[desire]].<ref>{{E}} p.269</ref>
