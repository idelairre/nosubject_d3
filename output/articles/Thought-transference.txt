<blockquote>There is, for example, the phenomenon of thought-transference, which is closely allied to telepathy and, indeed, can be identified with it without much difficulty. It is held that psychological processes, ideas, states of excitement, volitions, which occur in the mind of one person, can be transferred through space to another, without the usual means of communication (words or signs) being employed. Incidentally it is remarhble that it is actually these phenomena which find the least mention in the old accounts of the miraculous.<ref>{{NILP}} Ch. 2</ref></blockquote>
