=====Introduction=====

* [[Law]] is [[split]]
* There is a [[parallax view|parallax]] [[gap]] between the '''[[public]] [[letter]]''' and its '''[[obscene]] [[superego]] [[supplement]]'''''.<ref>{{Z}} ''[[The Parallax View]]''. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2006. p. 10.</ref>


* [[law]] is ''necessary'' and potentially ''liberatory''.
: Appearing in mutiple arrangements - the [[symbolic]] [[law]] of [[language]] and [[law|norms]], the [[public]] [[law]] of [[state]]s and [[state|regimes]], the [[transgressive]] "[[obscene|nightly]]" [[law]] of [[superego]], as well as the [[religion|religious]] [[law]] of [[Judaism]] and the [[Pauline]] [[law]] of [[faith]] - [[law]] persists as a constituent element of human practical experience.


Yet ''[[law]] as such is [[lack|incomplete]]''.

==Law's Founding==

===Founding Crime===

===Founding Law===

==''Split Law''==

How does [[violence]] ''persist'' in [[law]], and what is its relation to '''[[law|split law]]'''?

===Surplus===

As a non-integrated, [[surplus]], 

[[Violence]] ''persists'' in the form of [[law]] as an ''[[injunction]]''.

[[Violence]] gives [[law]] the form of an ''[[injunction]]''.


As a nonintegrated [[surplus]], [[violence]] gives [[law]] the form of an ''[[injunction]]'', rendering [[law]] as that which is to be obeyed.

'''Law''' is constitutively senseless: it is obeyed not because it is [[good]], just, or beneficial, but because it is [[law]].

As [[Zizek]] explains, "The last foundation of the [[Law]]'s authority lies in its process of [[enunciation]]."<ref>{{Z}} "How Did Marx Invent the Symptom?" in ''[[Mapping Ideology]]''. Ed. Slavoj Zizek. Verso: London, 1944. p. 318</ref>

This traumatic, nonintegrated character of [[law]] is a positive condition of [[law]].<ref>{{Z}} "How Did Marx Invent the Symptom?" in ''[[Mapping Ideology]]''. Ed. Slavoj Zizek. Verso: London, 1944. p. 319</ref>

This [[trauma]]tic, [[senseless]] [[injunction]] is also the psychoanalytic notion of the [[superego]].

[[Superego]] issues unconditional commands, telling us what to do, refusing to take no for an answer, refusing even to consider our specific circumstances, needs or desires.

The [[superego]] command is thus more than a simple [[prohibition]].  It is a [[prohibition]] compliance with which produces [[enjoyment]].  When we obey the [[superego]], when we give up our own [[desire]] and comply or follow orders, a part of us, or, more precisely the [[Other]] within us, [[enjoy]]s.

'''[[Superego]] thus involves the [[excess]] of [[law]], the [[violence]] that ''persists'' in [[law]]'s ''[[injunction]]''.'''


The [[superego]] [[injunction|injunction to enjoy]] accompanies a duty to be happy.  Important for Zizek is the way that in today's more permissive societies, the superego injunction to enjoy accompanies a duty to be happy. He writes, "The superego is thus the properly obscene reversal of the permissive 'You may!' into the prescriptive 'You must!', the point at which permitted enjoyment turns into ordained enjoyment."<ref>{{TFA}} {{FA}} p. 133</ref> We must have great sex lives, fulfilling jobs, interesting hobbies, fantastic vacations. If we do not, we have somehow failed. We are guilty-inadequate. By attending to the superego supplement of law, Zizek thus enables us to grasp how it is the case that what might appear at law's retreat, as law's securing of a larger realm of personal choice and privacy, comes up against a crippling impasse of unfreedom-the command to enjoy that effectively prevents us from enjoying, entwining us in guilt and uncertainty.

===Lack===

[[Violence]] persists as [[superego]], that is, as the punishing, powerful, obscene, dead [[father]] killed by the primal horde.

==Enjoying Law==

===The Object in Law: From Superego to Objet Petit a===

===Attachment to Law: From Enjoyment Through Duty to Enjoyment in Love===

==Conclusion: Hope in Law==
