<i>[[Ornicar?]]</i> (Subtitle: <i>Bulletin périodique du champ Freudien</i> (Journal of the Freudian field)) is the title of a journal founded in January 1975 by [[Jacques-Alain Miller]], [[Jacques Lacan]]'s son-in-law.

[[Lacan ]]supported it against the opposition of the elder members of the [[École Freudienne de Paris]] ([[Freudian School of Paris]]). 

<i>[[Ornicar?]]</i> is also the journal of the Department of the Freudian Field at the University of Vincennes, which was founded by Serge Leclaire in 1968 and was led and directed by Lacan and Miller from 1970.

From the start, [[Miller]], who was entrusted with the transcription of [[Lacan]]'s seminar, used <i>[[Ornicar?]]</i> as a venue for publishing seminar sessions. 

Published seminars include <i>R.S.I.</i> (The real, the symbolic, and the imaginary; 1974-1975) in nos. 2-5; <i>Le Sinthome</i> (The symptom; 1975-1976) in nos. 6-11; <i>L'une-bévue</i> (A blunder; 1976-1977) in nos. 12-18; and the final seminar, <i>Dissolution</i> (1980) in nos. 20-23. 

With the publication in no. 9 of a talk that Lacan delivered on January 5, 1977, "The Inauguration of the Clinical Program," <i>[[Ornicar?]]</i> became a vehicle for elaborating Lacan's clinical technique, which was developed and taught outside of the [[École Freudienne]] at [[Vincennes]].

From January 1975 to June 1989, twenty-eight issues of <i>[[Ornicar?]]</i> were published under [[Miller]]'s editorship. 
These issues included reprints of psychiatric classics and essays on contemporary clinical practice.

After [[Lacan]]'s [[death]] in 1981, [[Miller]] began to publish some of [[Lacan]]'s unpublished writings in <i>[[Ornicar?]]</i> (nos. 24-25), starting with the seven lectures on <i>[[Hamlet]]</i> from seminar 6, <i>[[Le désir et son interprétation]]</i> ([[Desire and its interpretation]]).

[[Laurence Bataille]], the daughter of [[Sylvia Lacan]] and [[Georges Bataille]] and the stepdaughter of [[Lacan]], acted as director of the publication from 1976 to 1978 and helped to edit the journal before eventually withdrawing.
In 1998, starting with no. 49, the journal got a new lease on life under the direction of [[Miller]].
