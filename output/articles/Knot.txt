The [[knot]] is a [[topology|topological]] [[structure]] used by [[Jacques Lacan]] to define the relationship of the [[symbolic]], the [[real]], and the [[imaginary]].


[[Jacques Lacan]] refers to the [[topology|topological]] [[structure]] of the [[knot]] in order to describe the relations  between the [[imaginary]], the [[symbolic]], and the [[real]].

Lacan mainly considered two nodal structures:
* The [[Borromean Knot]]: three component loops joined together in such a way that when one loop is cut the other two are no longer connected;
* The clover-leaf knot: the three components have been connected together into a single continuous loop.

For Lacan, the knot symbolizes the Imaginary. As an imaginary construct, it gives consistency to the symbolic. Taken symbolically, the knot represents the undecidability of the real or imaginary.

The knot is an object located in space. A two-dimensional representation of it is made by means of crossings over or under. The knot's structure is determined by what crosses over or under what. However, the knot's structure is not dependent on its representation. Indeed, it was to translate representation into structure that an algebraic writing system for knots was developed. This writing system was refined over the course of the twentieth century and gradually made it possible to distinguish among different types of knots. In this system, the knot's topological loops become letters (in the form of polynomials). This marks the fact that the knot originates in the lost letter.

In Lacan's spoken lectures, the knot functioned first and foremost as a piece of writing. This called into question of the relationship between speech and writing, and showed that "writeability" is essential to the formation of the unconscious (Sigmund Freud's "Letter 52" to Wilhelm Fliess). "The unconscious can only be expressed in knots of language" (Lacan).

In particular, he referred to the structure of rings on the coat of arms of the Borromei family. After introducing this notion on February 9, 1972, in his seminar ". . . ou pire" (. . . or worse), he made the knot a central focus of his theory.
