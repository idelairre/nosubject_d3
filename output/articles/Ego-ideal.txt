==Sigmund Freud==
==Ego-Ideal, Ideal Ego and Superego==
In [[Freud]]'s writings it is difficult to discern any systematic distinction between the three related terms "[[ego-ideal]]" (''[[Ich-ideal]]''), "[[ideal ego]]" (''[[Ideal Ich]]''), and [[superego]] (''[[Superego|Über-Ich]]''), although neither are the terms simply used interchangeably. 

==Jacques Lacan==
[[Lacan]], however, argues that these three "[[ego-ideal|formations of the ego]]" are each quite distinct concepts which must not be confused with one another.

==Ego-Ideal and Superego==
In his pre-war writings [[Lacan]] is mainly concerned to establish a distinction between the [[ego-ideal]] and the [[superego]], and does not refer to the [[ideal ego]].

===Identification with the Father===
Although both the [[ego-ideal]] and the [[superego]] are linked with the decline of the [[Oedipus complex]], and both are products of [[identification]] with the [[father]], [[Lacan]] argues that they represent different aspects of the [[father]]'s dual role.

===Repression and Sublimation===
The [[superego]] is an [[unconscious]] [[agency]] whose function is to [[repression|repress]] [[sexuality|sexual]] [[desire]] for the [[mother]], whereas the [[ego-ideal]] exerts a [[conscious]] pressure towards [[sublimation]] and provides the coordinates which enable the [[subject]] to take up a [[sexual difference|sexual position]] as a [[man]] or [[woman]].<ref>{{L}} ''[[Works of Jacques Lacan|Les complexes familiaux dans la formation de l'individu. Essai d'analyse d'une fonction en psychologie]]'', Paris: Navarin, 1984. p. 59-62</ref>

==Ego-Ideal and the Ideal Ego==
In his post-war writings [[Lacan]] pays more attention to distinguishing the [[ego-ideal]] from the [[ideal ego]] ([[Fr]]. ''[[moi idéal]]'').  Thus in the 1953-4 [[seminar]], he develops the [[optical model]] to distinguish between these two [[formation]]s. 

===Introjection and Projection===
He argues that the [[ego-ideal]] is a [[symbolic]] [[introjection]], whereas the [[ideal ego]] is the source of an [[imaginary]] [[projection]].<ref>{{S8}} p. 414</ref>

===Symbolic===
The [[ego-ideal]] is the [[signifier]] operating as [[idealism|ideal]], an internalized plan of the [[law]], the guide governing the [[subject]]'s position in the [[symbolic]] [[order]], and hence anticipates secondary ([[Oedipal]]) [[identification]] or is a product of that [[identification]].<ref>{{S1}} p. 141</ref>

<!--
But for the subject to come into being, one must find "a guide beyond the imaginary, on the level of the symbolic plane. . . . This guide governing the subject is the ego-ideal" (1988a, p. 141). The ego-ideal, according to Lacan, is the Other (caregiver) speaking. From that point on, the symbolic order (language) dominates over the imaginary order, which is reduced to being a decoy
-->
===Imaginary===
The [[ideal ego]], on the other hand, originates in the [[specular image]] of the [[mirror stage]]; it is a promise of future [[dialectic|synthesis]] towards which the [[ego]] tends, the [[illusion]] of [[autonomy|unity]] on which the [[ego]] is built.

The [[ideal ego]] always accompanies the [[ego]], as an ever-present attempt to regain the omnipotence of the [[preoedipal]] [[dual relation]]. Though formed in [[primary identification]], the [[ideal ego]] continues to play a role as the source of all [[secondary identification]]s.<ref>{{E}} p. 2</ref>. 

==Lacanian Algebra==
The [[ideal ego]] is written '''<i>i(a)</i>''' in [[Lacan]]ian [[algebra]], and the [[ego ideal]] is written '''I(A)'''.
