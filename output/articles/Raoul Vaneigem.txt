VANIEGEM, RAUOUL
(1935-)
Belgian situationist.
His ''Revolution of Everyday Life'' (1967) is one of the classics of [[situationism]], alongside [[Debord]]'s ''[[Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967).

Much less philosophically abstract and closer to the [[anarchist]] tradition than [[Debord]]. [[Vaneigem]] predicts a [[revolution]] in everyday life that will be brought about by a spontaneous explosion of poetic creativity and the founding of a small self-governing communities that will unleash a free human creativity.

His vision of poetic creativity is strongly influenced by the tradition of [[Dada]]; in [[Vaniegem]]'s view, riots and vandalism are forms of spontaneous poetry.

His vision of sexual [[revolution]] is decidedly prefeminist and owes a lot to [[Reich]]'s views of the emancipatory function of the orgasm.

His commends on the manner in which advertisements influence consumers through a mechanism of [[interpellation]] are intriguingly similar to [[Althusser]]'s these on [[ideology]].





[[Vaneigem]]'s polemical denunciation of the [[society of the spectacle]] comprises a powerful and often witty description of the kaleidoscopic flow of [[sign]]s which, by using the mechanism of [[interpellation]], transforms [[individual]]s into actors who play out [[alienating]] roles.

The function of the ideological, artistic and cultural spectacle is to transform the wolves of spontaneity into the sphepards of [[knowledge]] and [[beauty]].

Although he broke with what was left of the [[Situationist International]] in 1972, [[Vaneigem]] continues to write in a recognizably [[situationist]] style (1995).

A similar notion of [[interpellation]] can be found in [[Vaneigem]]'s contribution to the theory of [[situationism]] (1967).

Confronted by the flow of [[sign]]s and [[image]]s that cosntitute [[Debord]]'s '[[society of the spectacle]]', [[individual]]s are constantly [[interpellated]] by posters, advertisements and stereotypes offering universal [[image]]s in which they are invited to recognize themselves.

The function of [[interpellation]] is to block spontaneous creativity.

Whether or not there is any direct connection between the two notions of [[interpellation]] remains unclear.
