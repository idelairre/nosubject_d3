The [[Rome Discourse]] marked [[Lacan]]'s break with the [[International Psychoanalytical Association|analytic establishment]] and the formation of his own [[school]] of [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic thought]].

Characterized by a mardedly polemical style of presentation, it is a manifesto of the aims of [[Lacan]]ian [[psychoanalysis]].

In it [[Lacan]] catigated contemporary [[psychoanalytic theory]] and [[practice]] and proposed a radical revision of the whole [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] field.

------

The main thrust of the [[Rome Discourse]] pushes for the revision of [[psychoanalysis]] by a [[return]] to the study of the properties of [[language]], with which the early Freud was particularly concerned.

It is a long and difficult text, covering a wide variety of issues, some of which are fully developed, while others are merely mentioned briefly.

Our aim here is not to outline its main points, concentrating on those most relevant to [[psychoanalysis]].
 
------

In the [[Rome Discourse]] [[Lacan]] questioned the main concepts of [[psychoanalysis]] and took up issues shared with such [[science|human sciences]] as [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]] and [[anthropology]].

In [[Lacan]]'s view, [[psychoanalysis]] is distinguished from other disciplines in that the [[analyst]] works on the [[subject]]'s [[speech]].

<blockquote>"Whether it sees itself as an instrument of healing, or of exploration in depth, psychoanalysis has only a single medium: the patient's speech."<ref>{{E}} p. 40</ref></blockquote>

From the birth of [[analysis]], [[language]] has been its primary field of action and the priveleged instrument of its efficacy, it is the "talking cure."<ref>{{SE}} 2. p. 30</ref>
