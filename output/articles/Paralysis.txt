==Hysteria==
[[Lacan]] also uses the idea of the [[fragmented body]] to explain certain typical [[symptom]]s of [[hysteria]]. 

When a [[hysteria|hysterical]] [[paralysis]] affects a limb, it does not respect the physiological structure of the nervous system, but instead reflects the way the [[body]] is divided up by an 'imaginary anatomy'. 

In this way, the [[fragmented body]] is "revealed at the organic level, in the lines of fragilization that define the anatomy of phantasy, as exhibited in the schizoid and spasmodic symptoms of hysteria."<ref>E, 5</ref>
