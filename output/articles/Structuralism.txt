[[Lacan]] drew heavily from the [[structuralism|structuralist approach]], but he was ''not'' a [[structuralism|structuralist]] for two important reasons.

First, while [[structuralism]] viewed the [[subject]] as a mere effect of [[symbolic]] [[structure]]s, [[Lacan]] argued that the [[subject]] is not simply reducible to an effect of [[language]] and the [[symbolic|symbolic order]]. 

Second, for [[Structuralism]], a [[structure]] is always [[complete]], while for [[Lacan]] the [[structure]] - the [[symbolic order]] - is never [[complete]]. There is always something left over; an [[excess]] or something that exceeds the [[symbolic]]. What exceeds the [[symbolic]] is the [[subject]] and the [[object]].
