<blockquote>The phenomena of superstition furnish another indication of the unconscious motivation in chance and faulty actions.<ref>{{PEL}} Ch. 10</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>''Because'' the superstitious person knows nothing of the motivation of his own accidental actions, and because the fact of this motivation strives for a place in his recognition, he is compelled to dispose of them by displacing them into the outer world. As a matter of fact, I believe that a large portion of the mythological conception of the world which reaches far into the most modern religions, ''is nothing but psychology projected to the outer world''.<ref>{{PEL}} Ch. 10</ref></blockquote>
