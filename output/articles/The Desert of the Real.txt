=Is this the end of fantasy?=
<p>Christopher Isherwood, an Englishman who became an American, once 
gave 
expression to the unreality of American daily life, exemplified in 
the motel room: “American motels are unreal! … They are deliberately 
designed to be unreal. … The Europeans hate us because we’ve retired 
to live inside our advertisements, like hermits going into caves to 
contemplate.” 
</p><p></p>
<p> The Wachowski brothers’ 1999 hit film The Matrix brought this 
logic to its extreme climax: The material reality we all experience 
and see around us is a virtual one, generated and coordinated by 
a gigantic mega-computer to which we are all attached. When the 
hero, played by Keanu Reeves, awakens into the “real reality,” he 
sees a desolate landscape littered with burned ruins—what remained 
of Chicago after a global war. The resistance leader Morpheus utters 
the ironic greeting: “Welcome to the desert of the real.”</p>
<p> Was it not something of a similar order that took place in New 
York on September 11? As we were introduced to the “desert of the 
real,” the landscape and the shots we saw of the collapsing towers 
could only remind us of the most breathtaking scenes from innumerable 
Hollywood disaster movies. The unthinkable had been the object of 
fantasy. In a way, America got what it fantasized about, and this 
was the greatest surprise.</p>

<p> It is precisely now, when we are dealing with the raw reality 
of a catastrophe, that we should bear in mind the ideological and 
fantasmatic coordinates that determine its perception. If there 
is any symbolism in the collapse of the World Trade Center, it is 
not that the Twin Towers stood for capitalism per se, but of virtual 
capitalism, of financial speculations disconnected from the sphere 
of material production. The towers symbolized, ultimately, the stark 
separation between the digitized First World and the Third World’s 
“desert of the real.”</p>
<p> The American sphere of safety is now experienced by its citizens 
as being under threat from an Outside of terrorist attackers who 
are ruthlessly self-sacrificing and cowards, cunningly intelligent 
and primitive barbarians. Whenever we encounter such a purely evil 
Outside, we should gather the courage to remember the Hegelian lesson: 
In this evil Outside, we should recognize the distilled version 
of our own essence. For the past five centuries, the (relative) 
prosperity and peace of the “civilized” West was bought by the export 
of ruthless violence and destruction to the “savage” Outside. It’s 
a long story, from the conquest of America to the slaughter in Congo.</p>
<p> Cruel and indifferent as it may sound, we should also, now more 
than ever, bear in mind that the actual effect of these attacks 
is much more symbolic: In Africa, every single day more people die 
of AIDS than all the victims of the attacks on the World Trade Center 
and the Pentagon, and their deaths can and could have been easily 
minimized with relatively small financial means. The United States 
got a taste of what goes on around the world on a daily basis, from 
Sarajevo to Grozny, from Rwanda and Congo to Sierra Leone. If one 
adds to the situation in New York rape gangs and a dozen or so snipers 
blindly targeting people who walk along the streets, one gets an 
idea of what Sarajevo was like a decade ago.</p>
<p> Now, we are forced to strike back, to deal with real enemies in 
the real world … but whom to strike? Whatever the response, it 
will never hit the right target, bringing us full satisfaction. 
The spectacle of America attacking Afghanistan would be just that: 
If the greatest power in the world were to destroy one of the poorest 
countries, where peasants barely survive on barren hills, would 
this not be the ultimate case of the impotent acting out? Afghanistan 
is already reduced to rubble, destroyed by continuous war during 
the past two decades. The impending attack brings to mind the anecdote 
about the madman who searches for his lost key beneath a street 
light; asked why he searches there, when he actually lost the key 
in a dark corner, he answers: “But it is easier to search under 
strong light!” Is it not the ultimate irony that Kabul already looks 
like downtown Manhattan?</p>
<p> To succumb to the urge to retaliate now means precisely to avoid 
confronting the true dimensions of what occurred on September 11—it 
means an act whose true aim is to lull us into the secure conviction 
that nothing has really changed. The true long-term threats are 
further acts of mass terror in comparison to which the memory of 
the World Trade Center collapse will pale—acts less spectacular, 
but much more horrifying. What about biological warfare, the use 
of lethal gas or the prospect of DNA terrorism—the development 
of poisons that will affect only people who share a determinate 
genome? Instead of a quick acting out, one should confront these 
difficult questions: What will “war” mean in the 21st century? Who 
will be “them”?</p>

<p> There is a partial truth in the notion of a “clash of civilizations” 
attested here. Witness the surprise of the average American: “How 
is it possible that these people display and practice such a disregard 
for their own lives?” Is the obverse of this surprise not the rather 
sad fact that we, in the First World countries, find it more and 
more difficult even to imagine a public or universal cause for which 
one would be ready to sacrifice one’s life?</p>
<p> But a brief look at the comparative history of Islam and Christianity 
tells us that the “human rights record” (to use an anachronistic 
term) of Islam is much better than that of Christianity: In past 
centuries, Islam was significantly more tolerant toward other religions 
than Christianity. It was through the Arabs that, in the Middle 
Ages, Western Europeans regained access to the ancient Greek legacy. 
We are not dealing with a feature inscribed into Islam as such, 
but with the outcome of modern socio-political conditions. This 
notion of the “clash of civilizations” has to be thoroughly rejected: 
What we are witnessing today are rather clashes within each civilization.</p>
<p> Indeed, every feature attributed to the Outside is already present 
in the very heart of the United States. Murderous fanaticism? What 
about the rightist, populist “fundamentalists” who also practice 
a terror of their own, legitimized by (their understanding of) Christianity? 
Since America is in a way “harboring” them, should the U.S. Army 
have punished its own country after the Oklahoma City bombing? And 
what about the way Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson reacted to the 
attacks on September 11, perceiving them as a sign that God had 
lifted his protection because of the sinful lives of Americans, 
putting the blame on hedonist materialism, liberalism and rampant 
sexuality, and claiming that America got what it deserved?</p>
<p> It is still too early to tell how the events of September 11 will 
be symbolized or what acts they will be evoked to justify. Even 
now, in these moments of utmost tension, this link is not automatic 
but contingent. We already see the first bad omens, like the sudden 
resurrection, in the public discourse, of the old Cold War term 
“free world”: The struggle is now the one between the “free world” 
and the forces of darkness and terror. The question to be asked 
here is: Who then belongs to the unfree world? Are, say, China or 
Egypt part of this free world?</p>
<p> The day after the attacks, I got a message from a journal that 
was just about to publish a longer text of mine on Lenin, telling 
me that they decided to postpone its publication—they considered 
it inopportune to publish a text on Lenin immediately after the 
terrorist attacks. Does this point toward ominous ideological rearticulations 
to come, with a new Berufsverbot (prohibition to employ radicals) 
much stronger and more widespread than the one in the Germany of 
the ’70s? </p>

<p> These days, one often hears the phrase that the struggle is now 
the one for democracy—true, but not quite in the way this phrase 
is usually meant. Already, some leftist friends of mine have written 
me that, in these difficult moments, we had better keep our heads 
down and not push forward with our agenda. Against this temptation 
to duck out the crisis, one should insist that now the left should 
provide a better analysis. To not do so is to concede in advance 
the left’s political and ethical defeat in the face of acts of quite 
genuine heroism on the part of ordinary people—like the passengers 
who, in a model of rational ethical action, apparently overtook 
the hijackers and provoked the early crash of the fourth plane over 
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p> So what about the phrase that reverberates everywhere, “Nothing 
will be the same after September 11”? Significantly, this phrase 
is never further elaborated—it’s just an empty gesture of saying 
something “deep” without really knowing what we want to say. So 
our reaction to this phrase should be: Really? Or is it rather that 
the only thing effectively changed was that America was forced to 
realize the kind of world it is part of?</p>
<p> Such changes in perception are never without consequences, since 
the way we perceive our situation determines the way we act in it. 
Recall the processes of collapse of a political regime—say, 
the collapse of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. At a certain 
moment, people all of a sudden became aware that the game was over, 
that the Communists had lost. The break was purely symbolic, nothing 
changed “in reality”—and, nonetheless, from that moment on, 
the final collapse of the regime was just a question of days.</p>
<p> What if something of the same order did occur on September 11? 
We don’t yet know what consequences in economy, ideology, politics 
and war this event will have, but one thing is sure: The United 
States, which, until now, perceived itself as an island exempted 
from this kind of violence, witnessing these kind of things only 
from the safe distance of a TV screen, is now directly involved. 
So the question is: Will Americans decide to further fortify their 
sphere, or risk stepping out of it? America has two choices. It 
can persist in or even amplify its deeply immoral attitude of “Why 
should this happen to us? Things like this don’t happen here,” leading 
to even more aggression toward the Outside—just like a paranoiac 
acting out. Or America can finally risk stepping through the fantasmatic 
screen separating it from the Outside world, accepting its arrival 
into the desert of the real—and thus make the long-overdue 
move from “A thing like this should not happen here” to “A thing 
like this should not happen anywhere!”</p>
<p> Therein resides the true lesson of the attacks: The only way to 
ensure that it will not happen here again is to prevent it from 
going on anywhere else. America should learn to humbly accept its 
own vulnerability as part of this world, enacting the punishment 
of those responsible as a sad duty, not as an exhilarating retaliation. 
Even though America’s peace was bought by the catastrophes going 
on elsewhere, the predominant point of view remains that of an innocent 
gaze confronting unspeakable evil that struck from the Outside. 
One needs to gather the courage to recognize that the seed of evil 
is within us too.</p>

<p> In his campaign for the presidency, George W. Bush named Jesus 
Christ as the most important person in his life. Now he has a unique 
chance to prove that he meant it seriously. For him, as for all 
Americans today, “Love thy neighbor” means “Love the Muslims.” Or 
it means nothing at all.
