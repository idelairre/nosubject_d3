Class
Class, according to Marx, is similarly situated people who share the same wants and needs; 
classes do not simply appear, they are slowly and often painstakingly formed.  Through a
long and complex process of struggling together about issues of local and later national
interest to them, they gradually become a unity, a true class.   (Tong, Rosemarie.  Feminist
Thought:  A More Comprehensive Introduction, 1998, p. 97-98.)

Class in Marxist theory, is both race- and sex-blind.  (Chris Kramarae & Paula A. Treichler. 
Amazons, Bluestockings, and Crones, Pandora Press, 1992, p. 96.)

Class "Is not defined by our relationship to the mode of production in the simple sense that
if we sell our labor power (for a day or a lifetime), or are part of the family of someone
(presumably male) who does, we are working-class.  Being working-class is a mode of life,
a way of living life based on, but not exclusively defined by, the simple fact that we must
sell our labor power to stay alive.  Class distinctions in capitalist society are part of a
totality, a mode of life structured as well by sexism and racism...."  (Chris Kramarae &
Paula A. Treichler.  Amazons, Bluestockings, and Crones, Pandora Press, 1992, p. 96.)

The structure of capitalism produces two opposing classes:  a ruling class whose members
own and control the means of production and a working class whose members, lacking
such ownership, sell their labor power to capital in order to survive.  (Abramovitz, Mimi. 
Regulating the Lives of Women, 1989, p. 19.)
