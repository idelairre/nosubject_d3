==Freudian Dictionary==
<blockquote>In the phallic phase there are the first signs of an organization which subordinates the other trends to the primacy of the genitals and signifies the beginning of a co-ordination of the general persuit of pleasure into the sexual function.<ref>{{OoPA}} Ch. 3</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>This is, as it were, a forerunner of the final shape of sexual life, and already greatly resembles it. It is to be noted that what comes in question at this stage is not the genitals of both sexes but only those of the male (the phallus). The female genitals long remain unknown: in the child's attempt at understanding sexual processes, he pays homage to the venerable cloacal theory-a theory which has a genetic justification. <ref>{{OoPA}} Ch. 3</ref></blockquote>


===Phallic Phase in Girls==
<blockquote>We may assume that, in the phallic phase of the girl, the clitoris is the dominant erotogenic zone. But it is not destined to remain so; with the change to femininity, the clitoris must give up to the vagina its sensitivity, and, with it, its importance, either wholly or in part.<ref>{{NILP}} Ch. 5</ref></blockquote>
