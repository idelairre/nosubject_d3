Autoeroticism is the practice of fulfilling one's own sexual needs without a partner. 


==Autosexuals==

In Greek Mythology [[Narcissus]] is somtimes considered an autosexual, although Pausanias story points to him being [[incest|incestuous]]. In [[Ovid|Ovid's]] [[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]] poem he describes the Greek tale of Narcissus and the [[nymph]] Echo. Echo is in love with Narcissus but all he can see is his own 'beautiful' reflection in the water. Echo's longing eventually means that all is left of her is a sad lonely cry.
