==Dialectic==
The "[[beautiful soul]]" is a [[stage]] in the [[dialectic]] of [[self-consciousness]] which [[Hegel]] describes in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.<ref>[[Hegel|Hegel, G. W. F.]] ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', trans. A. V. Miller, with Analysis of the Text and Foreward by J. N. Findlay, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985 [1807].</ref>  The [[beautiful soul]] projects its own disorder onto the world and attempts to [[cure]] this disorder by imposing "the law of the heart" on everyone else. 

==Ego==
For [[Lacan]], the [[beautiful soul]] is a perfect [[metaphor]] for the [[ego]]:

<blockquote>"[T]he ego of modern man ... has taken on its form in the dialectical impasse of the ''belle âme'' who does not recognise his very own ''raison d'être'' in the disorder that he denounces in the world."<ref>{{E}} p. 70</ref></blockquote>

==Paranoia==
In a more extreme way, the [[beautiful soul]] also illustrates the [[structure]] of [[paranoia]]c [[misrecognition]] (''[[méconnaissance]]'').<ref>{{Ec}} pp. 172-3</ref>

==Neurosis==
The concept of the [[beautiful soul]] illustrates the way that [[neurosis|neurotics]] often deny their own [[responsibility]] for what is going on around them. 

==Ethics of Psychoanalysis==
The [[ethics]] of [[psychoanalysis]] enjoin [[analysand]]s to recognize their own part in their [[suffering]]s.

==Dora==
Thus when [[Dora]] complains about being treated as an [[object]] of exchange by the men around her, [[Freud]]'s first intervention is to confront her with her own complicity in this exchange.<ref>{{Ec}} p. 218-19</ref>
