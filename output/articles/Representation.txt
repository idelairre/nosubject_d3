[[Freud]] distinguished between "[[word-presentations]]" -- the product of the secondary processes of [[consciousness|conscious thought]] - and "[[thing-presentations]]" - the product of the primary processes of the [[unconscious]]. 

These are very complicated ideas in Freud and he never explicitly spelt out what he meant by them.
