'''Ernesto Laclau''' is a [[political theory|political theorist]] often described as [[Post-marxism | post-marxist]].  He is a professor at the [[University of Essex]] where he holds a chair in [[political science|Political Theory]] and was for many years director of the doctoral program in [[Ideology]] and [[Critical discourse analysis|Discourse Analysis]].
He has lectured extensively in many universities in [[North America]], [[Latin America]], [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]].

Laclau's most important book is ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]'', which he co-authored with [[Chantal Mouffe]]. Their thought is usually described as post-Marxist as they were both politically active in the social and student movements of the [[1960s]] and thus tried to join working class and [[new social movements]]. They rejected [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[economic determinism]] and the notion of [[class struggle]] being the crucial [[antagonism]] in [[society]]. Instead they urged for radical [[democracy]] of [[agonistic pluralism]] where all antagonisms could be expressed. In their opinion "...there is no possibility of society without antagonism", that is why they claimed that "society does not exist."
