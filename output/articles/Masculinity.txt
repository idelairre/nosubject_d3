According to [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], the lesson of [[psychoanalysis]] is that the [[subject]] is inherently divided and can never be [[satisfaction|satisfied]].  We are plagued as [[subject]]s by the [[anxiety]] that our ''[[jouissance]]'' - our [[pleasure]] or [[enjoyment]] - is never enough. In other words, we are driven by an inherent dissatisfaction and sense of insufficiency.

We constantly have the sense that there is something ''more''; we do not know what this is, but we have the sense that it is there, and we want it. This is the form of jouissance that Lacan identifies as [[phallus|phallic]] [[jouissance]]. 

[[phallus|Phallic]] [[jouissance]] is that form of [[enjoyment]] that most of us experience most of the time; that is to say, just when we think we possess our [[object]] of [[desire]] - be that another person, a new possession or even a difficult idea we have been struggling to get hold of - we are still dissatisfied; we are disappointed and have a sense that our [[desire]] has not been fully satisfied. This sense of (dis)satisfaction that always leaves something wanting is precisely what [[Lacan]] calls [[phallus|phallic]] [[jouissance]] and defines the [[masculine]] [[structure]]. 

A [[masculine]] [[structure]] is characterized by turning the [[Other]] into an [[objet a]], and mistakenly thinking that the [[object]] can fully [[satisfy]] our [[desire]]. It is essential to keep in mind here, though, that [[phallic]] [[jouissance]] is not [[male]] in the sense that only [[men]] can experience it; it is experienced by both [[men]] and [[women]] and is defined as [[phallus|phallic]] insofar as it is characterized by failure.

The Lacanian 'formulae of sexuation" make up a crucial part of Žižek's thinking: one way of characterizing the overall trajectory of his work is as a movement from a masculine logic of the universal and its exception towards a feminine logic of a not-all' without exception. 
Everything in Žižek can ultimately be understood in terms of these two formulae. 
As Žižek asks: 'What if sexual difference is ultimately a kind of zero-institution of the social split of humankind, the naturalized, minimal zero-difference, a split that. prior to signalling any determinate social difference, signals this difference as such? The struggle for hegemony would then, once
again, be the struggle for how this zero-difference is overdetermined by other particular social differences." (p. 338)
