A mental illness whose symptoms are either prohibitions and atonements (e.g., washing one's hands over and over) or symbolic substitute gratifications. As always for Freud, the problem's core is repressed sexual wishes--in this case the desire to masturbate. We now call this Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.
