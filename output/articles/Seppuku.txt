<blockquote>Why is an [[act]] not mere behaviour? Let us concentrate, for example, on an [[act]] that is unambiguous, the act of cutting open one's belly in certain conditions - incidentally, it's not called ''hara-kiri'', but ''seppuku''.  WHy do people do that? Because they think it annoys others, because, in the structure, it is an act that is done in honour of something.  But wait.  Let us not be precipitate until we know, and let us take note of this, that an act, a true act, always has an element of structure, by the fact of concerning a real that is not self-evidently caught up with it.</blockquote>
