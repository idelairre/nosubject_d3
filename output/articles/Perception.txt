==Definition==
In the [[mirror stage]] the [[infant]] sees its [[reflection]] in the [[mirror]] as  a [[whole]]/[[synthesis]], and this [[perception]] causes, by contrast, the [[perception]] of its own [[body]] (which [[lack]]s [[motor coordination]] at this [[stage]]) as [[division|divided]] and [[fragmentation|fragmented]].
