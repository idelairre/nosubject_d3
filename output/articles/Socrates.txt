Socrates (ca. 470 â€“ 399 BCE) was a Greek Athenian philosopher.

He is best known outside philosophy for being condemned to death by an Athenian people's court and choosing to die by drinking hemlock. He had been charged with impiety and with corrupting Athenian youth through his teachings [1] and had been given the opportunity to go into exile. However, he chose to die as sentenced as he believed he would otherwise dishonor the agreement he had willingly made to abide by the laws of Athens.
