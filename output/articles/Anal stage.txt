The '''anal stage''' in [[psychology]] is the term used by [[Sigmund Freud]] to describe the [[development]] during the second year of [[life]], in which a [[child]]'s [[pleasure]] and [[conflict]] centers are in the [[anal]] area. 

This [[stage]] is exemplified by a toddler's pleasure in controlling his or her bowels. 

This is second of Freud's [[psychosexual stages]].  

According to [[Freud]]'s theories, inability to resolve the [[conflict]]s of this [[stage]] may cause [[anal retentive]]ness.

As the physical ability to control the sphyncter matures (2-3 years of age), the [[child]]'s attention shifts from the [[oral]] to the [[anal]] zone.

This change provides further outlets for libidinal gratification ([[anal]] [[erotism]]) and for the emerging aggressive drive ([[anal]] [[sadism]]).

The concept of [[fixation]] kicks in here. 

When there is [[excess]]ive [[gratification]] in this [[stage]], it leads to the [[development]] of extremely generous, unorganized personalities. 

When [[gratification]] does not occur, the individual becomes extremely organized.
