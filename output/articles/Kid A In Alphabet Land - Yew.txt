'''Kid A In Alphabet Land Zaps Another Zuper Zero - The Zany Z-Man!'''

Am I Your Illegitimate Spawn, Or Are You My Illegitimate Father? Who Gives A Shit? You Say That If I Truly Loved You, I Would Mutilate You - But That Is Your Desire, Not Mine, For I Was Never Your Disciple, And Will Not Take Your Discipline! If I've Imposed Upon You, It's Only Because You're An Impostor - You Know Nothing! You Cannot Separate Me From My Desire!
