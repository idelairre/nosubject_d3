==Translator's Note==
"''Manque''" is translated here as "lack", except in the expression, created by [[Lacan]], "''manque-à-être''", for which [[Lacan]] himself has proposed the English neologism "want-to-be".

==Lack and Desire==
The term "[[lack]]" is always related, in [[Lacan]]'s teaching, to [[desire]].  It is a [[lack]] which causes [[desire]] to arise.<ref>{{S8}} p. 139</ref>  However, the precise nature of what is [[lack]]ing varies over the course of [[Lacan]]'s [[Works of Jacques Lacan|work]].

==Lack of Being==
When the term first appears, in 1955, [[lack]] designates first and foremost a [[lack|lack of being]].  What is [[desire]]d is [[being]] itself.

<blockquote>Desire is a relation of being to lack.  The lack is the lack of being properly speaking.  It isn't the lack of this or that, but lack of being whereby the being exists."<ref>{{S2}} p. 223</ref></blockquote>

[[Lacan]] returns to this theme in 1958, when he argues that [[desire]] is the [[metonymy]] of the [[lack|lack of being]] (''[[lack|manque à être]]'').<ref>{{E}} p. 259; translated by Sheridan as "want-to-be"</ref>  The [[subject]]'s [[lack|lack of being]] is "the heart of the analytic experience" and "the very field in which the neurotic's passion is deployed.<ref>{{E}} p. 251</ref>  [[Lacan]] contrasts the [[lack|lack of being]], which relates to [[desire]], with the [[lack|lack of having]] (''[[lack|manque à avoir]]''), which relates to [[demand]].<ref>{{Ec}} p. 730</ref>

==Lack of an Object==
In 1956, [[lack]] comes to designate the [[lack]] of an [[object]].  [[Lacan]] distinguishes between three kinds of [[lack]], according to the nature of the [[object]] which is [[lack]]ing, as shown in the figure below.<ref>{{S4}} p. 269</ref>
<!-- In the child as in the adult, the lack of the object can appear in three specific modes: frustration, privation, and castration. In each of these three cases there is lack of the object, but in each case the nature of the lack is qualitatively different. The same is true of the type of object in question. -->

Of these three forms of [[lack]], [[castration]] is the most important from the point of view of [[treatment|analytic experience]], and the term "[[lack]]" tends to become synonymous with [[castration]].

In 1957, when [[Lacan]] introduces the [[algebraic]] [[symbol]] for the [[bar]]red [[Other]] (<strike>A</strike>), [[lack]] comes to designate the [[lack]] of a [[signifier]] in the [[Other]].  [[Lacan]] introduces the [[symbol]] '''S(<strike>A</strike>)''' to designate "the signifier of a lack in the Other."  No matter how many [[signifier]]s one adds to the [[signifying chain]], the [[chain]] is always [[lack|incomplete]]; it always [[lack]]s the [[signifier]] that could complete it.  This "[[lack|missing signifier]]" (written '''-1''' in [[Lacan]]ian [[algebra]]) is constitutive of the [[subject]].
