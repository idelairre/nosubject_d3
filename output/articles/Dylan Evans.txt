[[Evans, Dylan]]. [[An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis]]. 2003. New York: Brunner-Routledge.

=====Book Description=====
Jacques Lacan's thinking revolutionized the theory and practice of psychoanalysis and had a major impact in fields as diverse as film studies, literary criticism, feminist theory and philosophy. Yet his writings are notorious for their complexity and idiosyncratic style.

Emphasizing the clinical basis of Lacan's work, An Introductionary Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis is an ideal companion to his ideas for readers in every discipline where his influence is felt. The dictionary features: over 200 entries, explaining Lacan's own terminology and his use of common psychoanalytic expressions; details of the historical and institutional context of Lacan's work; reference to the origins of major concepts in the work of Freud, Saussure, Hegel and other key thinkers; and a chronology of Lacan's life and works.

This introduction provides a unique source of reference for psychoanalysts in training and in practice. Placing Lacan's ideas in their clinical context, the dictionary is also an ideal companion for readers in other disciplines.


=====Turn away from Lacan=====
Evans grew disillusioned with Lacanian psychoanalysis, and turned into a disciple of evolutionary psychology. On this, he has written in an essay published under the title ‘From Lacan to Darwin’ in The Literary Animal; Evolution and the Nature of Narrative.
