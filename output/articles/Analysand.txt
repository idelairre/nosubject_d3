{{Topp}}analysant]], [[psychanalysant{{Bottom}}

Before 1967 [[Lacan]] refers to the one who is "in" [[psychoanalytic treatment]] as the "[[patient]]" or the "[[subject]]", or uses the technical term [[analysand|''analysé'']].  However, in 1967, [[Lacan]] introduces the term [[analysand|''analysant'']], based on the [[English]] term "[[analysand|analysand]]".<ref>{{Lacan}} 1967. p.18</ref>  [[Lacan]] refers this term because, being derived from the gerund, it indicates that the one who lies on the couch is the one who does most of the work.  This contrasts with the old term [[analysand|''analysé'']] which, being derived from the passive participle, suggests either a less active participation in the [[treatment|analytic process]], or that the [[treatment|analytic process]] has [[end of analysis|finished]].  In [[Lacan]]'s view, the [[analysand]] is not "[[treatment|analysed]]" by the [[analyst]]; it is the [[analysand]] who [[treatment|analyze]]s and the task of the [[analyst]] is to help him to [[treatment|analyze]] well.
