Some people believe that [[psychoanalysis]] has the medical model of [[treatment]] and [[cure]].  The social acceptance of [[analysis]] seems to be based on the idea that it can provide [[cure]]s.  If this is the case it is part of [[medicine]]. 

In contrast, [[Lacan]] tried to introduce a break between [[psychoanalysis]] and [[medicine]].  He said that his theorization had nothing whatever to do with [[medicine]] or even with [[natural]] [[science]].  [[Psychoanalysis]] did not have as its goal curing [[patient]]s; if people in [[analysis]] did get better, it was a welcome side-effect.  

If the goal of [[analysis]] is not [[cure]], what is it?  [[Lacan]] believed that the direction of analysis ought to lead towards a verbalization of the [[unconscious]].

<!-- Lacan was strongly opposed to the SPP's requirement that analysts undergo medical training and saw psychoanalysis as much more closely aligned to philosophy and the arts, and later to mathematics, than to medicine. From the outset Lacan's work was rooted on the one hand in clinical work but on the other in a broader cultural understanding of the unconscious and mental illness. Unlike Anglo-American psychiatry and psychology, the French tradition has always retained a more poetic or aesthetic element. This may be just one further reason why it became so pervasive in Humanities departments in the 1970s. -->
