=====Psychosis=====
[[Paranoia]] is a form of [[psychosis]] characterized principally by [[delusions]]. 

=====Sigmund Freud=====
[[Freud]]'s experience of [[treatment|treating]] [[paranoiacs]] was limited.

=====Shreber Case=====
[[Freud]]'s most extensive work on [[paranoia]] is an [[analysis]] of the written memoirs of a [[paranoiac]] -- a judge named [[Daniel Paul Schreber]].<ref>{{F}} "[[Works of Sigmund Freud|Psycho-Analytic Notes on an Autobiogrpahical Account of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)]]", 1911. [[SE]] XII: 3.</ref>

=====Homosexuality=====
It is in this work that [[Freud]] puts forward his theory that [[paranoia]] is a [[defence]] against [[homosexuality]], arguing that the different forms of [[paranoiac]] [[delusion]] are based on different ways of [[negation|negating]] the phrase "I (a man) love him."

=====Jacques Lacan=====
[[Lacan]]'s interest in [[paranoia]] predates his interest in [[psychoanalysis]].

=====Case of Aimée=====
It is the subject of his first major work, his doctoral dissertation.<ref>{{1932}}</ref>  In this work, [[Lacan]] discusses a [[psychotic]] [[woman]] whom he calls "[[Aimée]]", whom he diagnoses as suffering from "[[paranoia|self-punishment paranoia]]" (''[[paranoïa d'autopunition]]'') - a new [[structure|clinical structure]] proposed by [[Lacan]] himself. 

=====Seminar III=====
[[Lacan]] returns to the [[subject]] of [[paranoia]] in his [[seminar]] of 1955-6, [[Seminar III|The Psychoses]] which he devotes to a sustained commentary on the [[Schreber]] [[case]].  [[Lacan]] finds [[Freud]]'s [[theory]] about the [[homosexual]] roots of [[paranoia]] inadequate and proposes instead his own [[theory]] of [[foreclosure]] the specific [[mechanism]] of [[psychosis]].

==Paranoiac Structure==
Like all [[clinical structure]]s, [[paranoia]] reveals in a particularly vivid way certain basic features of the [[psyche]]. 

===Paranoiac Alienation===
The [[ego]] has a [[paranoiac]] [[structure]]<ref>{{E}} p. 20</ref> because it is the site of a [[paranoiac]] [[alienation]].<ref>{{E}} p. 5</ref> 

===Paranoiac Knowledge===
[[Knowledge]] (''[[connaissance]]'') itself is [[paranoiac]].<ref>{{E}} p. 2, 3, 17</ref>

===Analytic Treatment===
The process of [[psychoanalytic treatment]] induces controlled [[paranoia]] into the [[human]] [[subject]].<ref>{{E}} p. 15</ref>
