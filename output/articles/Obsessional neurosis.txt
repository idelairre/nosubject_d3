==Sigmund Freud==
===Symptoms===
[[Obsessional neurosis]] was first developed as a diagnostic category by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1894.  In doing so, [[Freud]] grouped together as one condition a series of [[symptom]]s which had been described long before but which had been linked with a variety of different diagnostic categories.<ref>Laplanche, Jean and Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand. ''The Language of Psycho-Analysis'', trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith, London: Hogarth Press and the Institute of Psycho-Analysis, 1973 [1967]: 281-2</ref>  These [[symptom]]s include obsessions (recurrent ideas), impulses to perform actions which seem absurd and/or abhorrent to the [[subject]], and "rituals" (compulsively repeated actions such as checking or washing).

==Jacques Lacan==
===Structure===
While [[Lacan]] also sees these [[symptom]]s as typical of [[obsessional neurosis]], he argues that [[obsessional neurosis]] designates not a set of [[symptom]]s but an underlying [[structure]] which may or may not manifest itself in the [[symptom]]s typically associated with it.  Thus the [[subject]] may well exhibit none of the typical obsessional [[symptom]]s and yet still be diagnosed as an [[obsessional neurotic]] by a [[Lacan]]ian [[analyst]].

==Neurosis==
Following [[Freud]], [[Lacan]] classes [[obsessional neurosis]] as one of the main forms of [[neurosis]].

===Question of Existence===
In 1956, [[Lacan]] develops the idea that, like [[hysteria]], [[obsessional neurosis]] is essentially a question which [[being]] poses for the [[subject]].<ref>{{S3}} pp. 179-80</ref>  The question which constitutes [[obsessional neurosis]] concerns the contingency of one's [[existence]] (which also testifies to the special burden of [[guilt]] felt by the [[obsessional]]); the [[obsessional]] performs some compulsive ritual because he thinks that this will enable him to escape the [[lack]] in the [[Other]], the [[castration]] of the [[Other]], which is often represented in [[fantasy]] as some terrible disaster.

===Example of Rat Man===
For example, in the case of one of [[Freud]]'s [[obsessional neurotic]] [[patient]]s, whom [[Freud]] nicknamed the [[Rat Man]], the [[patient]] had developed elaborate rituals which he performed to war off the [[fear]] of a terrible punishment being inflicted on his [[father]] or on his beloved.<ref>[[Freud|Freud, Sigmund]]. "[[Works of Sigmund Freud|Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis]]," 1909d. [[SE]] X, 155</ref>

===Structure of Religion===
These rituals, both in their form and content, led [[Freud]] to draw parallels between the [[structure]] of [[obsessional neurosis]] and the [[structure]] of [[religion]], parallels which [[Lacan]] also notes.

===Sexual Position===
Whereas the [[hysterical]] question concerns the [[subject]]'s [[sexual position]] ("Am I a [[man]] or a [[woman]]?"), the [[obsessional neurotic]] repudiates this question, refusing both sexes, calling himself neither [[male]] nor [[female]]:

<blockquote>"The obsessional is precisely neither one [sex] nor the other - one may also say that he is both at once."<ref>{{S3}} p. 249</ref></blockquote>

===Attitude to Time===
[[Lacan]] also draws attention to the way that the [[obsessional neurotic]]'s question about [[existence]] and [[death]] has consequences for his attitude to [[time]].  This attitude can be one of perpetual hesitation and procrastination while waiting for [[death]],<ref>{{E}} p. 99</ref> or of considering oneself immortal because one is already [[dead]].<ref>{{S3}} p. 180</ref>

===Guilt and Anal Eroticism===
Other features of [[obsessional neurosis]] which [[Lacan]] comments on are the sense of [[guilt]], and the close connection with anal eroticism.  In respect of the latter, [[Lacan]] remarks that the [[Obsessional neurosis|obsessional neurotic]] does not only transform his shit into gifts and his gifts into shit, but also transforms himself into shit.<ref>{{S8}} p. 243</ref>
