Heraclitus of Ephesus (Greek Ἡράκλειτος Herakleitos) (about 535 - 475 BC), known as "The Obscure", was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher from Ephesus in Asia Minor. The details of Heraclitus' life are almost completely unknown. "Reliable information is limited to the fact that he was a native of Ephesus, on the coast of Asia Minor north of Miletus, and that his father's name was Bloson."[1] Heraclitus is the first person in the history of the western world to have put forward a robust philosophical system. His writings have later influences upon Socrates and Plato. 19th Century Philosophy has also paid close attention to Heraclitus.
