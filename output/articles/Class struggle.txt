As [[Žižek]] himself admits, this might sound rather abstract but he is able to provide a concrete example of the way his theory works in terms of [[class struggle]]. 
For [[Žižek]], the ]]class struggle]] belongs to the [[Order]] of the [[Real]]. 
We do not encounter it directly in ]]reality]], but only via its [[Symbolization]]. 
As the [[class struggle]] is [[Real]], it forms a blockage in the [[Symbolic]] which manifests itself in different attempts to [[Symbolize]] it, to recuperate it within [[reality]]. 
These attempts index the antagonistic character of the [[class struggle]], by which [[Žižek]] means to convey that the [[class struggle]] is the constitutive [[split]] which forms [[society]]. 
The [[class struggle]] is what holds [[society]] together, it is our mutual [[bond]], but at the same time it is what prevents [[society]] from forming an [[organic]] [[whole]], it is what drives a wedge between us all. 
The very visible [[absence]] of [[class struggle]] right now is, for [[Žižek]], evidence of a struggle in which one side has (temporarily) won. 
The [[class struggle]] does not [[objective]]ly [[exist]]-we can only see it or not see it from a particular, [[subjective]] or [[ideological]] point of view.

In terms of [[Žižek]]'s theory, then, the [[spectre]] of [[ideology]] conceals the failed [[Symbolization]] of the [[antagonism]] of [[class struggle]] in the [[Real]]. 
To put it another way, [[ideology]] fills out the [[abyss]] of the [[antagonism]]-it patches over the [[hole]] in [[reality]] (the [[Symbolic]] [[Order]]).<ref>{{Myers}} p.75-76</ref>
