''L'objet petit a'' can thus be defined as a pure [[parallax]] [[object]]: it is not only that its contours change with the shift of the [[subject]]; it only [[exists]] - its presence can only be discerned - when the landscape is viewed from a certain perspective. More precisely, the object a is the very CAUSE of the parallax [[gap]], that unfathomable X which forever eludes the [[symbolic]] grasp and thus causes the [[multiplicity]] of symbolic perspectives. The paradox is here a very precise one: it is at the very point at which a pure [[difference]] emerges - a difference which is no longer a difference between two positively existing objects, but a [[difference|minimal difference]] which divides one and the same object from itself - that this difference "as such" immediately coincides with an unfathomable object: in contrast to a mere difference between objects, the pure difference is itself an object. Another name for the parallax gap is therefore minimal difference, a "pure" difference which cannot be grounded in positive substantial properties.<ref><u>[[The Parallax View]].</ref></blockquote>
