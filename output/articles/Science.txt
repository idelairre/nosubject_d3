=====Scientific Discourse=====
Both [[Freud]] and [[Lacan]] use the term "[[science]]" in the singular, thus implying that there is a specific unified, homogeneous kind of [[discourse]] that can be called "[[science|scientific]]". 

This [[discourse]] begins, according to [[Lacan]], in the seventeenth century <ref>{{Ec}} p. 857</ref>, with the inauguration of modern physics.<ref>{{Ec}} p. 855</ref>.

=====Sigmund Freud=====
=====Science and Religion=====
[[Freud]] regarded [[science]] as one of [[civilization]]'s highest achievements, and opposed it to the reactionary forces of [[religion]]. 

=====Jacques Lacan=====
[[Lacan]]'s attitude to [[science]] is more ambiguous. 

On the one hand, he criticizes [[science|modern science]] for ignoring the [[symbolic]] dimension of [[human]] [[existence]] and thus encouraging modern man "to forget his subjectivity."<ref>{{E}} p. 70</ref>. 

He also compares [[science|modern science]] to a "fully realised paranoia," in the sense that its totalizing constructions resemble the architecture of a [[delusion]].<ref>{{Ec}} p.874</ref>

=====Positivist Model=====
On the other hand, these criticisms are not levelled at [[science]] per se, but at the [[science|positivist model]] of [[science]]. 

[[Lacan]] implies that [[science|positivism]] is actually a deviation from "[[science|true science]]", and his own model of [[science]] owes more to the [[science|rationalism]] of Koyré, Bachelard and Canguilhem than to [[science|empiricism]]. 

=====Formalization=====
In other words, for [[Lacan]], what marks a [[discourse]] as [[science|scientific]] is a high degree of [[mathematical]] [[formalization]]. 

This is what lies behind [[Lacan]]'s attempts to [[formalize]] [[psychoanalytic theory]] in terms of various [[mathematical]] [[algebra|formulae]]. 

These [[algebra|formulae]] also encapsulate a further characteristic of [[science|scientific discourse]], which is that it should be transmissible.<ref>{{TV}} p. 60</ref>.

=====Truth=====
[[Lacan]] argues that [[science]] is characterized by a particular relationship to [[truth]]. 

On the one hand, it attempts to monopolize [[truth]] as its exclusive property <ref>{{Ec}} p. 79</ref>; and, on the other hand, [[science]] is in fact based on a [[foreclosure]] of the concept of [[truth]] as [[cause]].<ref>{{Ec}} p. 874</ref>.

=====Knowledge=====
[[Science]] is also characterised by a particular relationship to [[knowledge]] (''[[knowledge|savoir]]''), in that [[science]] is based on the exclusion of any access to [[knowledge]] by recourse to intuition and thus forces all the search for [[knowledge]] to follow only the path of reason.<ref>{{Ec}} p. 831</ref>. 

====="Subject of Science"=====
The [[subject|modern subject]] is the "[[science|subject of science]]" in the sense that this exclusively rational route to [[knowledge]] is now a common presupposition. 

In stating that [[psychoanalysis]] operates only the [[subject]] of [[science]],<ref>{{Ec}} p. 858</ref> [[Lacan]] is arguing that [[psychoanalysis]] is not based on any appeal to an ineffable experience or flash of intuition, but on a process of reasoned dialogue, even when reason confronts its limit in [[madness]].

=====Human And Natural Sciences=====
Although the distinction between the [[science|human sciences]] and the [[science|natural sciences]] had become quite well-established by the end of the nineteenth century, it does not figure in [[Freud]]'s work. 

[[Lacan]], on the other hand, pays great attention to this distinction. 

However, rather than talking of the "[[science|human sciences]]" and the "[[science|natural sciences]]", [[Lacan]] prefers instead to talk of the "[[science|conjectural sciences]]" and the "[[science|exact sciences]]." 

=====Conjectural and Exact Sciences=====
Whereas the [[science|exact sciences]] concern the field of phenomena in which there is no one who uses a [[signifier]],<ref>{{S3}} p. 186</ref> the [[science|conjectural sciences]] are fundamentally different because they concern beings who inhabit the [[symbolic]] [[order]]. 

In 1965, however, [[Lacan]] problematizes the distinction between [[science|conjectural]] and [[science|exact]] [[science]]s:

<blockquote>The opposition between the [[science|exact sciences]] and the [[science|conjectural sciences]] can no longer be sustained from the moment when conjecture is susceptible to an exact calculation and when exactitude is based only on  a formalism which separates axioms and [[law]]s of grouping [[symbol]]s.<ref>{{Ec}} p. 863</ref></blockquote>

Whereas in the last century physics provided a paradigm of exactitude for the [[science|exact sciences]] which made the [[science|conjectural sciences]] seem sloppy by comparison, the arrival on the scene of [[structuralism|structural]] [[linguistics]] redressed the imbalance by providing an equally exact paradigm for the [[science|conjectural sciences]]. 

=====Natural Sciences=====
When [[Freud]] borrowed terms from other [[science]]s, it was always from the [[science|natural sciences]] because these were the only [[science]]s around in [[Freud]]'s day that provided a model of rigorous investigation and thought. 

[[Lacan]] differs from [[Freud]] by importing concepts mainly from the "[[science]]s of subjectivity," and by aligning [[psychoanalytic theory]] with these rather than with the [[science|natural sciences]]. 

[[Lacan]] argues that this paradigm shift is in fact implicit in [[Freud]]'s own reformulations of the concepts that he borrowed from the [[science|natural sciences]].

=====Structural Linguistics=====
In other words, whenever [[Freud]] borrowed concepts from [[biology]] he reformulated those concepts so radically that he created a totally new paradigm which was quite alien to its [[biological]] origins. 

Thus, according to [[Lacan]], [[Freud]] anticipated the findings of modern [[structural]] [[linguists]] such as [[Saussure]], and his work can be better understood in the light of these [[linguistics|linguistic concepts]].

=====Is Psychoanalysis a Science?=====
[[Freud]] was quite explicit in affirming the [[science|scientific status]] of [[psychoanalysis]]: 

<blockquote>"While it was originally the name of a particular therapeutic method [...] it has now also become the name of a [[science]] - the [[science]] of unconscious mental processes."<ref>{{F}} ''[[Works of Sigmund Freud|An Autobiographical Study]]'', 1925a: [[SE]] XX, 70</ref></blockquote>

However, he also insisted on the unique character of [[psychoanalysis]] that sets it apart from the other [[science]]s:

<blockquote>"Every [[science]] is based on observations and experiences arrived at through the medium of our psychical apparatus. But since our [[science]] has as its subject that apparatus itself, the analogy ends here."<ref>{{F}} ''[[Works of Sigmund Freud|An Outline of Psycho-Analysis]]'', 1940a [1938]: [[SE]] XXIII, 159</ref></blockquote>

=====Jacques Lacan=====
The question of the status of [[psychoanalysis]] and its relationship with other disciplines is also one to which [[Lacan]] devotes much attention. 

In his pre-war writings, [[psychoanalysis]] is seen unreservedly in scientific terms.<ref>{{L}} "[[Work of Jacques Lacan|Au-delà du 'principe de realité']]", 1936. {{E}} pp. 73-92</ref>

However, after 1950 [[Lacan]]'s attitude to the question becomes much more complex.

=====Art=====
In 1953, he states that in the opposition [[science]] versus [[art]], [[psychoanalysis]] can be located on the side of [[art]], on condition that the term "[[art]]" is understood in the sense in which it was used in the Middle Ages, when the "liberal arts" included arithmetic, geometry, music and grammar.<ref>{{L}} "[[Works of Jacques Lacan|The Neurotic's Individual Myth]]," trans. Martha Evans, in L. Spurling (ed.), ''Sigmund Freud: Critical Assessments'', vol. II, ''The Theory and Practice of Psychoanalysis'', London and New York: Routledge, 1989, p. 224. [Originally published in ''Psychoanalytic Quaterly'', 48 (1979)].</ref>

=====Religion=====
However, in the opposition [[science]] versus [[religion]], [[Lacan]] follows [[Freud]] in arguing that [[psychoanalysis]] has more in common with [[science|scientific discourse]] than [[religion|religious discourse]]: 

<blockquote>"Psychoanalysis is not a religion. It proceeds from the same status as [[science]] itself."<ref>{{S11}} p. 265</ref></blockquote>

=====Scientific Status=====
If, as [[Lacan]] argues, a [[science]] is only constituted as such by isolating and defining its particular object of enquiry,<ref>[[Lacan]] argues that [[psychoanalysis]] has actually set [[psychology]] on a scientific footing by providing it with a proper object of enquiry -- the [[imago]]; <ref>{{L}} "[[Work of Jacques Lacan|Propos sur la causalité psychique]]", in {{E}} [1946]. pp. 151-93</ref>; {{Ec}} p. 188</ref> then, when in 1965 he isolates the ''[[objet petit a]]'' as the [[object]] of [[psychoanalysis]], he is in effect claiming a [[science|scientific status]] for [[psychoanalysis]].<ref>{{Ec}} p. 863</ref>.

However, from this point on [[Lacan]] comes increasingly to question this view of [[psychoanalysis]] as a [[science]]. 

In the same year he states that [[psychoanalysis]] is not a [[science]] but a "practice" (''pratique'') with a "[[science|scientific vocation]]",<ref>{{Ec}} p. 863</ref> though in the same year he also speaks of 'the [[science|psychoanalytic science]]."<ref>{{Ec}} p. 876</ref>. 

By 1977 he has become more categorical:

<blockquote>Psychoanalysis is not a [[science]]. It has no scientific status    - it merely waits and hopes for it. Psychoanalysis is a delusion  - a delusion which is expected to produce a [[science]]. .  . . It is a scientific delusion, but this doesn't mean that analytic practice will ever produce a [[science]]. <ref>{{L}} ''[[Seminar XXIV| Le Séminaire. Livre XXIV. L'insu que sait de l'une bévue s'aile à mourre, 1976-77'', published in ''Ornicar?'', nos 12-18, 1977-9; [[Seminar]] of 11 January 1977; ''[[Ornicar?]]'', 14: 4</ref></blockquote>

=====Linguistics and Mathematics=====
However, even when [[Lacan]] makes such statements, he never abandons the project of [[formalizing]] [[psychoanalytic theory]] in [[linguistic]] and [[mathematical]] terms. 

Indeed, the tension between the [[science|scientific formalism]] of the [[matheme]] and the semantic profusion of ''lalangue'' constitutes one of the most interesting features of [[Lacan]]'s later work.
