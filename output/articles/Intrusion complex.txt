''Click here for information about the notion of a "[[complex]]"''

The [[intrusion complex]] is one of the three 'family complexes' which [[Lacan]] discusses in his 1938 article on the family, and arises when the [[child]] first realises that he has siblings, that other subjects like him participate in the family [[structure]]. 

The emphasis here is on likeness; the child identifies with his siblings on the basis of the recognition of bodily similarity (which depends, of course, on their being a relatively small age difference between the subject and his siblings). 

It is this identification that gives rise to the "imago of the counterpart."<ref>{{L}} 1938: 35-9</ref>
