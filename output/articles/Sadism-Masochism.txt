==Definition==                            
The terms "[[sadism]]" and "[[masochism]]" were coined by Krafft-Ebing in 1893, with reference to the [[Marquis de Sade]] and Baron Sacher von Masoch. Though the term sadism has a longer history. It first appears in a French dictionary in 1834, just twenty years after the death of De Sade. Krafft-Ebing used the terms in  a very specific sense, to refer to a [[sexual]] [[perversion]] in which [[sexual]] [[satisfaction]] is dependent upon inflicting [[pain]] on others ([[sadism]]) or upon experiencing [[pain]] oneself ([[masochism]]). 

==Sigmund Freud==
When [[Freud]] took up the terms in his ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', he used them in the same sense as Krafft-Ebing.<ref>{{F}} ''[[Works of Sigmund Freud|Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', 1905d. [[SE]] VII, 125.</ref> Following Krafft-Ebing, [[Freud]] posited an intrinsic connection between [[sadism]] and [[masochism]], arguing that they are simply the [[active]] and [[passive]] aspects of a single [[perversion]].

==Jacques Lacan==
[[Lacan]] too argues that [[sadism]] and [[masochism]] are intimately related, both being related to the [[drive|invocatory drive]]<ref>{{S11}} p. 183</ref>  Both the [[masochist]] and the [[sadist]] locate themselves as the [[object]] of the [[drive|invocatory drive]], the [[voice]].  However, whereas [[Freud]] argues that [[sadism]] is primary, [[Lacan]] argues that [[masochism]] is primary, and [[sadism]] is derived from it: "sadism is merely the disavowal of masochism."<ref>{{S11}} p. 186</ref> Thus, whereas the [[masochist]] prefers to experience the [[pain]] of [[existence]] in his own [[body]], the [[sadist]] rejects this [[pain]] and forces the [[Other]] to bear it.<ref>{{Ec}} p. 778</ref> [[Masochism]] occupies a special place among the [[perversion]]s, just as the invoking [[drive]] occupies a privileged place among the [[drive|partial drive]]s; it is the "limit-experience" in the attempt to go ''beyond'' the [[pleasure principle]].

===Jouissance===
Although ''[[jouissance]]'' is linked to the sensation of physical or mental [[pain|suffering]], there is an important difference between [[masochism]] and ''[[jouissance]]''.  In [[masochism]], [[pain]] is a means to [[pleasure]]; [[pleasure]] is taken in the very fact of [[pain|suffering]] itself, so that it becomes difficult to distinguish [[pleasure]] from [[pain]].  With ''[[jouissance]]'', on the other hand, [[pleasure]] and [[pain]] remain distinct; no [[pleasure]] is taken in the [[pain]] itself, but the [[pleasure]] cannot be obtained without paying the price of [[pain|suffering]].  It is thus a kind of ''deal'' in which "[[pleasure]] ''and'' [[pain]] are presented as a single packet."<ref>Seminar of 27 February 1963. J. Lacan, The Seminar. Book VII: The Ethics of Psychoanalysis. p. 189.</ref>
