==Identification==
[[Transitivism]] -- a phenomenon first discovered by Charlotte BÃ¼hler -- refers to a special kind of [[identification]] often observed in the behaviour of small [[children]].<ref>{{E}} p. 5</ref>

==Children==
For example a [[child]] can hit another [[child]] of the same age on the left side of his face, and then touch the right side of his own face and cry in imagined pain. 

==Jacques Lacan==
For [[Lacan]], [[transitivism]] illustrates the confusion of [[ego]] and other which is inherent in [[imaginary]] [[identification]]. 

==Inversion==
The [[inversion]] (right to left) is further evidence of the function of the [[mirror]].

==Paranoia==
[[Transitivism]] is also evident in [[paranoia]], in which attack and counter-attack are bound together "in an absolute equivalence."
