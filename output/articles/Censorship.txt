 
The term [[censorship]] in everyday [[language]] connotes ideas of blame and [[repression]] of faults. 

This is how it appears in [[Freud]] in [[Studies on Hysteria]]: 

<blockquote>"we are very often astonished to realize in what a mutilated state all the ideas and scenes emerged which we extracted from the patient by procedure of pressing. Precisely the essential elements of the picture were missing [...] I will give one or two examples of the way in which a censoring of this kind operates..."<ref>1895b, p. 281-282</ref></blockquote>

He then shows that what is censored is what appears to the patient to be blameworthy, shameful, and inadmissible. 

In a letter to [[Wilhelm Fleiss]]<ref>December 22, 1897, in 1950a</ref> he compares this psychic work to the [[censorship]] that the czarist regime imposed on Russian newspapers at the time: 

<blockquote>"Words, sentences and whole paragraphs are blacked out, with the result that the remainder is unintelligible."<ref>1950a, p. 240</ref></blockquote>

Although the term appears quite frequently in writings from this first period, its status remains uncertain. 

[[Freud]] seems to be describing the deliberate suppression by [[patient]]s, in their [[communication]] with the doctor, of what they do not wish to reveal to him, as well as the mechanism and effects of [[unconscious]] [[repression]].<ref>1896b</ref> 

A second meaning appears when he evokes the [[censorship]] which, in [[dream-work]], results in a [[manifest]] text being presented as a riddle.<ref>Interpretation of Dreams, 1900a</ref>

The metapsychological texts of 1915 elaborate on the distinctions outlined in chapter seven of the [[Interpretation of Dreams]]. 

[[Censorship]] is in fact defined as that which opposes the return of that which is [[repressed]], at the two successive levels in the passage from the [[unconscious]] to the [[preconscious]] (the "antechamber") and on to the [[conscious]] (the "drawing-room").<ref>1915e</ref>

[[Censorship]] is thus clearly distinguished from [[repression]]: whereas [[repression]] rejects a representation and/or an [[affect]] into the [[unconscious]], [[censorship]] is what prevents it from re-emerging. 

[[Freud]] nevertheless confuses this distinction later when he writes, for example: 

<blockquote>"We know the self-observing agency as the ego-censor, the conscience; it is this that exercises the dream-censorship during the night, from which the repressions of inadmissible wishful impulses proceed."<ref>1916-17a, p. 429</ref></blockquote> 

With the introduction of the [[structural theory]] [[Freud]] made a new distinction, with the [[ego]] becoming the [[agent]] of the [[censorship]] under the [[superego]]—the merciless supervisor.<ref>1923b</ref>

Although the notion of [[censorship]] continues to be fairly widely used in [[psychoanalysis]] to describe [[resistance]] to the [[treatment]], it has scarcely received any further elaboration and its global nature may cause it to appear to be somewhat outmoded.
