==Early Work==

[[Lacan]] begins to use the term "[[demand]]" in 1958.


In the [[seminar]] of 1956-7, [[Lacan]] argues that the '''cry''' of the '''[[helplessness|human infant]]''' -- its '''call''' (''l'appel'') to the '''[[mother]]''' -- is not merely an [[instinct|instinctual signal]] but is "inserted in a synchronic world of cries organized in a symbolic system."<ref>{{S4}} p. 182, 188</ref>

In other words, the [[infant]]'s screams become organized in a [[linguistic]] [[structure]] long before the [[child]] is capable of articulating recognizable words.

==Need, Demand and Desire==
It is the [[symbolic|symbolic nature]] of the infant's screams which forms the kernel of [[Lacan]]'s concept of [[demand]], which Lacan introduces in 1958 in the context of his distinction between [[need]], [[demand]] and [[desire]].

==Articulation of Need==
Lacan argues that since the [[infant]] is incapable of performing the specific actions that would satisfy its [[biological]] [[need]]s, it must articulate those [[need]]s in vocal form ([[demand]]s) so that another (the [[mother]]) will perform the specific action instead.

The primary example of such a [[biological]] [[need]] is hunger, which the [[child]] articulates in a scream ([[demand]]) so that the [[mother]] will feed it.

==Demand for the Other's Love==
However, because the object]] which [[satisfies]] the [[child]]'s [[need]] is provided by another, it takes on the added significance of being a proof of the [[Other]]'s [[love]].

Accordingly [[demand]] too acquires a double function: in addition to articualting a [[need]], it also becomes a [[demand]] for [[love]].

And just as the [[symbolic]] function of the [[object]] as a proof of [[love]] overshadows its [[real]] function as that which [[satisfies]] a [[need]], so too the [[symbolic]] dimension of [[demand]] (as a [[demand]] for [[love]]) eclipses its real function (as an articulation of [[need]]).

=Desire=
It is this double function which gives birth to [[desire]], since while the [[need]]s which [[demand]] articulates may be [[satisfied]], the craving for [[love]] is unconditional and insatiable, and hence persists as a leftover even after the [[need]]s have been satisfied; this leftover constitutes [[desire]].

==Helplessness==
[[Demand]] is thus intimately linked to the [[human]] [[subject]]'s initial [[helplessness]].

By forcing the [[analysand]] to express himself entirely in [[speech]], the [[treatment|psychoanalytic situation]] puts him back in the position of the [[helpless]] [[infant]], thus encouraging [[regression]].

<blockquote>"Through the mediation of the demand, the whole past opens up right to early infancy. The subject has never done anything other than demand, he could not have survived otherwise, an we just follow on from there."<ref>{{E}} p. 254</ref></blockquote>

==Analysand==
However, while the [[speech]] of the [[analysand]] is itself already a [[demand]] (for a reply), this [[demand]] is underpinned by deeper [[demand]]s (to be [[cure]]d, to be revealed to himself, to become an [[analyst]]).<ref>{{E}} p. 254</ref>

==Analyst==
The question of how the [[analyst]] engages with these demands is crucial.

Certainly the [[analyst]] does not attempt to gratify the [[analysand]]'s [[demand]]s, but nor is it simply a question of [[frustration|frustrating]] them.

==Development==
In 1961, [[Lacan]] rethinks the various stages of libidinal organisation as forms of [[demand]]. 

The [[development|oral phase]] of [[development]] is constituted by a [[demand]] (made by the [[subject]]) to be fed (which is a [[demand]] made by the [[subject]]).

In the [[development|anal stage]], on the other hand, it is not a question of the [[subject]]'s [[demand]], but the [[demand]] of the [[Other]] (the parent who disciplines the child in potty-training).<ref>{{S8}} p. 238-46, 269</ref>

In both of these [[development|pregenital stage]]s the [[satisfaction]] of [[demand]] eclipses [[desire]]; only in the [[genital stage]] does [[desire]] comes to be fully constituted.<ref>{{S8}} p. 270</ref>
