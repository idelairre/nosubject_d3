[[Screen]] is a British journal of film studies, published since 1969.
[[Screen]] was originally the jounall of the Society for Education in Film and Television, which was founded by the British Film Institute in 1950.
SEFT was wound up in 1980, but ''Screen'' continues to be published by Oxford University Press.

''Screen'' has had a number of different incarnations.
The original bimonthly was relaunched as a quarterly in 1971 and almost immediately became a major conduit for the importation of so-called 'French theory'.
