'''Of Children in Swaddling Clothes'''<BR>
O cities of the sea, I behold in you your citizens, women as well as men tightly bound with stout bonds around their arms and Iegs by folk who will not understand your language; and you will only be able to give vent to your griefs and sense of loss of liberty by making tearful complaints, and sighs, and lamentations one to another; for those who bind you will not understand your language nor will you understand them.<ref>[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan, Jacques]]. [[The Agency of the Letter in the Unconscious or Reason Since Freud]]</ref>
