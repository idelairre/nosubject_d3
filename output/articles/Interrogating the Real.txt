=====Book Description=====
[[Image:Interrogatingthereal.jpg|200px|thumb|Book Cover]]
''Interrogating the Real'' is the first volume of the collected writings of Slavoj Žižek - undoubtedly one of the world's leading contemporary cultural commentators, and one of the most inspiring, provocative and entertaining cultural critics at work today. Drawing upon the full range of his prolific output, the articles here cover psychoanalysis, philosophy and popular culture, reflecting the remarkable breadth and depth of Žižek's interest in politics, culture and philosophy, and also showcasing his entertaining style.  A full and clear sense of Žižekian philosophy emerges, derived from Hegelian dialectics, Marxist politics and Lacanian psychoanalysis.  At the same time, Žižek’s witty and accessible approach to his subject and his choice of exemplars from pop culture ensure that this is a consistently fresh and surprising body of work.

The book includes a new preface by Žižek himself, as well as an introduction by the editors and a helpful glossary for those coming to Žižek’s work for the first time.
