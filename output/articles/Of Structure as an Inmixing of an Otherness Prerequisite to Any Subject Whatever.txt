* [[Lacan, Jacques]]. [[Of Structure as an Inmixing of an Otherness Prerequisite to Any Subject Whatever]]. Talk at John Hopkins University, Baltimore. 1966. <http://www.lacan.com/hotel.htm>

Somebody spent some time this afternoon trying to convince me that it would surely not be a [[pleasure]] for an English-speaking audience to listen to my bad accent and that for me to speak in [[English]] would constitute a risk for what one might call the transmission of my [[message]].  Truly, for me it is a great case of [[conscience]], because to do otherwise would be absolutely contrary to my own concept of the [[message]]: of the [[message]] as I will explain it to you, of the [[linguistic]] [[message]]. Many people talk nowadays about messages everywhere, inside the organism a hormone is a message, a beam of light to obtain teleguidance to a plane or from a satellite is a message, and so on; but the [[message]] in [[language]] is absolutely different. The message, our message, in all cases comes from the [[Other]] by which I understand "from the place of the Other."  It certainly is not the common [[little other|other]], the [[little other| other]] with a lower-case <i>o</i>, and this is why I have given a capital <i>O</i> as the initial letter to the [[Other]] of whom I am now speaking.  Since in this case, here in Baltimore, it would seam that the [[Other]] is naturally [[English]]-speaking, it would really be doing myself [[violence]] to speak [[French]].  But the question that this person raised, that it would perhaps be difficult and even a little ridiculous for me to speak [[English]], is an important argument and I also know that there are many French-speaking people present that do not understand English at all; for these my choice of English would be a security, but perhaps I would not wish them to be so secure and in this case I shall speak a little French as well. 


First, let me put forth some advice about [[structure]], which is the subject matter of our meeting.  It may happen that there will be mistakes, confusion, more and more approximative uses of this notion, and I think that soon there will be some sort of fad about this word.  For me it is different because I have used this term for a very long time; since the beginning of my teaching.  The reason why something about my position is not better known is that I addressed myself only to a very special audience, namely one of [[psychoanalysts]].  Here there are some very peculiar difficulties, because [[psychoanalysts]] really know something: of what I was talking to them about and that this thing is a particularly difficult thing to cope with for anybody who practices [[psychoanalysis]].  The subject is not a simple thing for the [[psychoanalysts]] who have something to do with the subject proper.  In this case I wish to avoid misunderstandings, <i>[[méconnaissance]]s</i>, of my position. 

<i>[[Méconnaissance]]</i> is a French word which I am obliged to use because there is no equivalent in [[English]].  <i>[[Méconnaissance]]</i> precisely implies the [[subject]] in its [[meaning]]; and I was also advised that it is not so easy to talk about the "[[subject]]" before an [[English]]-speaking audience.  <i>[[Méconnaissance]]</i> is not to <i>méconnaitre</i> my [[subjectivity]].  What exactly is in question is the status of the problem of the [[structure]]. 

When I began to teach something about [[Psychoanalysis]] I lost some of my audience, because I had perceived long before then the simple fact that if you open a book of [[Freud]], and particularly those books which are properly about the [[unconscious]], you can be absolutely sure -- it is not a probability but a certitude -- to fall on a page where it is not only a question of [[word]]s -- naturally in a book there are always words many printed words -- but [[word]]s which are the [[object]] through which one seeks for a way to handle the  [[unconscious]].  Not even the meaning of the [[word]]s, but [[word]]s in their flesh, in their [[material]] aspect.  A great part of the speculations of [[Freud]] is about [[pun]]ning in a [[dream]] or [[lapsus]], or what in French we call <i>calembour, homonymie</i>, or still the division of a word into many parts with each part taking on a new meaning after it is broken down.  It is curious to note, even if in this case it is not absolutely proven, that words are the only [[material]] of the [[unconscious]]. It is not proven but it is probable (and in any case I have never said that the [[unconscious]] was an assemblage of [[word]]s, but that the [[unconscious]] is precisely [[structure]]d).  I don't think there is such an [[English]] word but it is necessary to have this term, as we are talking about [[structure]] and the [[unconscious is structured as a language]].  What does that mean? 


Properly speaking this is a redundancy because "[[structured]]" and "as a [[language]]" for me mean exactly the same thing.  [[Structure]]d means my [[speech]], my [[:category:terms|lexicon]], etc., which is exactly the same as a [[language]].  And that is not all.  Which [[language]]?  Rather than myself it was my pupils that took a great deal of trouble to give that question a different [[meaning]], and to search for the formula of a reduced [[language]].  What are the minimum conditions, they ask themselves, necessary to constitute a [[language]]? Perhaps only four <i>signantes</i>, four [[signify]]ing elements are enough.  It is a curious exercise which is based on a complete error, as I hope to show you on the board in a moment.  There were also some [[philosophers]], not many really but some, of those present at my [[seminar]] in Paris who have found since then that it was not a question of an &quot;under&quot; [[language]] or of &quot;another&quot; [[language]], not [[myth]] for instance or [[phoneme]]s, but [[language]].  It is extraordinary the pains that all took to change the place of the question.  [[Myth]]s, for instance, do not take place in our consideration precisely because those are also [[structure]]d as a [[language]], and when I say &quot;as a [[language]]&quot; it is not as some special sort of [[language]], for example, [[mathematical]] [[language]], [[semiotical]] [[language]], or [[cinematographical]] [[language]]. [[Language]] is [[language]] and there is only one sort of [[languag]]e: [[concrete]] [[language]]&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp; [[English]] or [[French]] for instance&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;that people talk.  The first thing to start in this context is that there is no [[meta-language]]. For it is necessary that all so called [[meta-language]]s be presented to you with [[language]].  You cannot teach a course in [[mathematic]]s using only [[letter]]s on the board. It is always necessary to speak an ordinary [[language]] that is understood. 

It is not only because the [[material]] of the [[unconscious]] is a [[linguistic]] [[material]], or as we say in [[French]] <i>[[langagier]]</i> that the [[unconscious]] is [[structure]]d as a [[language]].  The question that the [[unconscious]] raises for you is a problem that touches the most sensitive point of the nature of [[language]] that is the question of the [[subject]].  The [[subject]] cannot simply be identified with the [[speaker]] or the personal pronoun in a sentence. In [[French]] the <i>[[ennoncé]]</i> is exactly the sentence, but there are many <i>[[ennoncé]]s</i> where there is no [[index]] of him who utters the <i>ennoncé</i>.  When I say &quot;it rains,&quot; the [[subject]] of the [[enunciation]] is not part of the [[sentence]].  In any case here there is some sort of difficulty.  The [[subject]] cannot always be identified with what the [[linguist]]s call &quot;the [[shifter]].&quot; 

The question that the nature of the [[unconscious]] puts before us is in a few words, that something always [[think]]s.  [[Freud]] told us that the [[unconscious]] is above all [[thought]]s, and that which [[think]]s is [[bar]]red from [[consciousness]].  This [[bar]] has many applications, many possibilities with regard to meaning.  The main one is that it is really a [[bar]]rier, a [[bar]]rier which it is necessary to jump over or to pass through.  This is important because if I don't emphasize this [[bar]]rier all is well for you.  As we say in [[French]], ''ça vous arrange'', because if something thinks in the floor below or underground things are simple; [[thought]] is always there and all one needs is a little [[consciousness]] on the [[thought]] that the living being is naturally thinking and all is well.  If such were the case, [[thought]] would be prepared by [[life]], [[naturally]], such as [[instinct]] for instance.  If [[thought]] is a [[natural]] process, then the [[unconscious]] is without difficulty.  But the [[unconscious]] has nothing to do with [[instinct]] or primitive [[knowledge]] or preparation of [[thought]] in some underground. It is a [[thinking]] with [[word]]s, with [[thought]]s that escape your vigilance, your state of watchfulness.  The question of vigilance is important.  It is as if a demon plays a game with your watchfulness.  The question is to find a precise status for this [[other]] [[subject]] which is exactly the sort of [[subject]] that we can determine taking our point of departure in [[language]]. 

When I prepared this little talk for you, it was early in the morning.  I could see Baltimore through the window and it was a very interesting moment because it was not quite daylight and a neon sign indicated to me every minute the change of time, and naturally there was heavy traffic and I remarked to myself that exactly all that I could see, except for some trees in the distance, was the result of [[thought]]s actively [[thinking]] [[thought]]s, where the function played by the subjects was not completely obvious.  In any case the so-called <i>[[Dasein]]</i> as a definition of the [[subject]], was there in this rather intermittent or fading [[spectator]]. The best [[image]] to sum up the [[unconscious]] is Baltimore in the early morning. 

Where is the [[subject]]?  It is necessary to find the [[subject]] as a [[lost object]].  More precisely this [[lost object]] is the support of the [[subject]] and in many cases is a more abject thing than you may care to consider&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;in some cases it is something done, as all [[psychoanalyst]]s and many people who have been psychoanalyzed know perfectly well.  That is why many [[psychoanalyst]]s prefer to return to a general [[psychology]], as the President of the New York Psychoanalytical Society tells us we ought to do.  But I cannot change things, I am a [[psychoanalyst]] and if someone prefers to address himself to a professor of [[psychology]] that is his affair.  The question of the [[structure]], since we are talking of [[psychology]], is not a term that only I use.  For a long time thinkers, searchers, and even inventors who were concerned with the question of the [[mind]], have over the years put forward the idea of [[unity]] as the most important and characteristic trait of [[structure]].  Conceived as something which is already in the [[reality]] of the organism it is obvious.  The organism when it is mature is a unit and functions as a unit.  The question becomes more difficult when this idea of [[unity]] is applied to the function of the [[mind]], because the [[mind]] is not a totality in itself, but these ideas in the form of the intentional [[unity]] were the basis; as you know, of all of the so-called [[phenomenological]] movement. The same was also true in [[physics]] and [[psychology]] with the so-called [[Gestalt]] school and the [[notion]] of <i>bonne forme</i> whose function was to join, for instance, a drop of water and more complicated ideas, and great [[psychologist]]s, and even the [[psychoanalyst]]s are full of the idea of &quot;total personality.&quot; At any rate, it is always the [[unifying]] [[unity]] which is in the foreground.  I have never understood this, for if I am a [[psychoanalyst]] I am also a man, and as a man my experience has shown me that the principal characteristic of my own [[human]] [[life]] and, I am sure, that of the people who are here&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;and if anybody is not of this opinion I hope that he will raise his hand&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;is that [[life]] is something which goes, as we say in [[French]],<i> Ã¡ la dérive</i>.  [[Life]] goes down the river, from time to time touching a bank; staying for a while here and there, without understanding anything&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;and it is the principle of [[analysis]] that nobody understands anything of what happens.  The idea of the [[unifying]] [[unity]] of the [[human]] condition has always had on me the effect of a scandalous [[lie]].

We may try to introduce another principle to [[understand]] these things.  If we rarely try to [[understand]] things from the point of view of the [[unconscious]], it is because the [[unconscious]] tells us something articulated in [[word]]s and perhaps we could try to search for their principle. 

I suggest you consider the [[unity]] in another light. Not a <i>unifying</i> [[unity]] but the countable unity one, two, three.  After fifteen years I have taught my pupils to count at most up to five which is difficult (four is easier) and they have [[understood]] that much.  But for tonight permit me to stay at two.  Of course what we are dealing with here is the question of the integer, and the question of integers is not a simple one as I think many people here know.  To count, of course, is not difficult.  It is only necessary to have, for instance, a certain number of sets and a one to-one correspondence.  It is true for example that there are exactly as many people sitting in this room as there are seats.  But it is necessary to have a collection composed of integers to constitute an integer, or what is called a natural number.  It is, of course, in part natural but only in the sense that we do not understand why it exists.  Counting is not an empirical fact and it is impossible to deduce the act of counting from empirical data alone.  [[Hume]] tried but Frege demonstrated perfectly the ineptitude of the attempt.  The real difficulty lies in the fact that every integer is in itself a unit. If I take two as a unit, things are very enjoyable, [[men]] and [[women]] for instance&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;[[love]] plus [[unity]]!  But after a while it is finished, after these two there is nobody, perhaps a [[child]], but that is another level and to generate three is another affair.  When you try to read the theories of [[mathematicians]] regarding numbers you find the formula &quot;n plus 1 (n + 1)&quot; as the basis of all the theories.  It is this question of the &quot;one more&quot; that is the key to the genesis of numbers and instead of this [[unifying]] [[unity]] that constitutes two in the first case I propose that you consider the real numerical genesis of two. 

It is necessary that this two constitute the first integer which is not yet born as a number before the two appears. You have made this possible because the two is here to grant existence to the first one: put <i>two</i> in the place of <i>one</i> and consequently in the place of the <i>two</i> you see <i>three</i> appear. What we have here is something which I can call the <i>mark</i>. You already have something which is marked or something which is not marked. It is with the first mark that we have the status of the thing. It is exactly in this fashion that Frege explains the genesis of the number; the class which is characterized by no elements is the first class; you have one at the place of zero and afterward it is easy to understand how the place of one becomes the second place which makes place for two, three, and so on. The question of the two is for us the question of the subject. and here we reach a fact of psychoanalytical experience in as much as the two does not complete the one to make two, but must repeat the one to permit the one to exist. This first repetition is the only one necessary to explain the genesis of the number, and only one repetition is necessary to constitute the status of the subject. The unconscious subject is something that tends to repeat itself, but only one such repetition is necessary to constitute it. However, let us look more precisely at what is necessary for the second to repeat the first in order that we may have a repetition. This question cannot be answered too quickly. If you answer too quickly, you will answer that it is necessary that they are the same. In this case the principle of the two should be that of twins&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;and why not triplets or quintuplets?  In my day we used to teach children that they must not add, for instance, microphones with dictionaries; but this is absolutely absurd, because we would not have addition if we were not able to add microphones with dictionaries or as [[Lewis Carroll]] says, cabbages with kings.  The sameness is not in things but in the <i>mark</i> which makes it possible to add things with no consideration as to their differences. The mark has the effect of rubbing out the difference, and this is the key to what happens to the subject, the unconscious subject in the repetition; because you know that this subject repeats something peculiarly significant, the subject is here, for instance, in this obscure thing that we call in some cases trauma, or exquisite pleasure. What happens? If the &quot;thing&quot; exists in this symbolic structure, if this unitary trait is decisive, the trait of the sameness is here. In order that the &quot;thing&quot; which is sought be here in you, it is necessary that the first trait be rubbed out because the trait itself is a modification. It is the taking away of all difference, and in this case, without the trait, the first &quot;thing:&quot; is simply lost. The key to this insistence in repetition is that in its essence repetition as repetition of the symbolical sameness is impossible. In any case, the subject is the effect of this repetition in as much as it necessitates the &quot;fading,&quot; the obliteration, of the first foundation of the subject, which is why the subject, by status, is always presented as a divided essence. The trait, I insist, is identical, but it assures the difference only of identity&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;not by effect of sameness or difference but by the difference of identity. This is easy to understand: as we say in French, <i>je vous numérotte</i>, I give you each a number; and this assures the fact that you are numerically different but nothing more than that. 

What can we propose to intuition in order to show that the trait be found in something which is at the same time one or two?  Consider the following diagram which I call an inverted eight, after a well-known figure: 

You can see that the line in this instance may be considered either as one or as two lines.  This diagram can be considered the basis of a sort of essential inscription at the origin, in the knot which constitutes the subject.  This goes much further than you might think at first, because you can search for the sort of surface able to receive such inscriptions.  You can perhaps see that the sphere, that old symbol for totality, is unsuitable.  A [[torus]], a Klein bottle, a cross-cut surface, are able to receive such a cut. And this diversity is very important as it explains many things about the structure of mental disease.  If one can symbolize the subject by this fundamental cut, in the same way one can show that a cut on a torus corresponds to the neurotic subject, and on a cross-cut surface to another sort of mental disease.  I will not explain this to you tonight, but to end this difficult talk I must make the following precision. 

I have only considered the beginning of the series of the integers, because it is an intermediary point between language and reality.  [[Language]] is constituted by the same sort of unitary traits that I have used to explain the one and the one more. But this trait in language is not identical with the unitary trait, since in language we have a collection of differential traits. In other words, we can say that language is constituted by a set of signifiers&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;for example,<i> ba, ta, pa</i>) etc., etc.&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp; a set which is finite. Each signifier is able to support the same process with regard to the subject, and it is very probable that the process of the integers is only a special case of this relation between signifiers. The definition of this collection of signifiers is that they constitute what I call the Other. The difference afforded by the existence of language is that each signifier (contrary to the unitary trait of the integer number) is, in most cases, not identical with itself&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;precisely because we have a collection of signifiers, and in this collection one signifier may or may not designate itself. This is well known and is the principle of Russell's [[paradox]]. If you take the set of all elements which are not members of themselves, the [[set]] that you constitute with such elements leads you to a paradox which, as you know, leads to a contradiction.  In simple terms, this only means that in a universe of discourse nothing contains everything, and here you find again the gap that constitutes the subject.  The [[subject]] is the introduction of a [[loss]] in [[reality]], yet nothing can introduce that, since by status [[reality]] is as full as possible.  The notion of a [[loss]] is the effect afforded by the instance of the trait which is what, with the intervention of the [[letter]] you determine, places&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;say al, a2, a3&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;and the places are spaces for a [[lack]].  When the [[subject]] takes the place of the [[lack]], a [[loss]] is introduced in the [[word]], and this is the definition of the [[subject]].  But to inscribe it, it is necessary to define it in a circle, what I call the [[otherness]], of the sphere of [[language]].  All that is [[language]] is lent from this [[otherness]] and this is why the [[subject]] is always a [[fading]] thing that runs under the [[chain]] of [[signifier]]s.  For the definition of a [[signifier]] is that it represents a [[subject]] not for another [[subject]] but for another [[signifier]].  This is the only definition possible of the [[signifier]] as different from the [[sign]].  The [[sign]] is something that represents something for somebody, but the [[signifier]] is something that represents a [[subject]] for another [[signifier]].  The consequence is that the [[subject]] [[disappear]]s exactly as in the case of the two [[unitary trait]]s, while under the second [[signifier]] appears what is called [[meaning]] or [[signification]]; and then in sequence the other [[signifier]]s appear and other [[signification]]s.

The question of [[desire]] is that the [[fading]] [[subject]] yearns to find itself again by means of some sort of encounter with this miraculous thing defined by the [[phantasm]].  In its endeavor it is sustained by that which I call the [[lost object]] that I evoked in the beginning&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;which is such a terrible thing for the imagination.  That which is produced and maintained here, and which in my vocabulary I call the [[object]], lower-case, [[a]], is well known by all [[psychoanalyst]]s as all [[psychoanalysis]] is founded on the [[existence]] of this peculiar [[object]].  But the relation between this [[bar]]red [[subject]] with this [[object]] (<i>[[a]]</i>) is the [[structure]] which is always found in the [[phantasm]] which supports [[desire]] in as much as [[desire]] is only that which I have called the [[metonomy]] of all [[signification]]. 

In this brief presentation I have tried to show you what the question of the [[structure]] is inside the [[psychoanalytical]] [[reality]].  I have not, however, said anything about such dimensions as the [[imaginary]] and the [[symbolical]].  It is, of course, absolutely essential to understand how the [[symbolic]] [[order]] can enter inside the<i>vécu</i>, lived experienced, of [[mental]] [[life]], but I cannot tonight put forth such an explanation.   Consider, however, that which is at the same time the least known and the most certain fact about this [[mythical]] [[subject]] which is the sensible phase of the [[living]] [[being]]: this fathomless thing capable of experiencing something between [[birth]] and [[death]], capable of covering the whole spectrum of [[pain]] and [[pleasure]] in a [[word]], what in [[French]] we call the <i>[[sujet]] de la [[jouissance]]</i>.  When I came here this evening I saw on the little neon sign the motto &quot;Enjoy Coca-Cola.&quot; It reminded me that in [[English]], I think, there is no term to designate precisely this enormous weight of [[meaning]] which is in the [[French]] [[word]] <i>[[jouissance]]</i>&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp; or in the [[Latin]] <i>[[fruor]]</i>. In the dictionary I looked up <i>[[jouir]]</i> and found &quot;to possess, to use&quot; but it is not that at all.  If the [[living]] [[being]] is something at all thinkable, it will be above all as [[subject]] of the <i>[[jouissance]]</i>; but this [[psychological]] [[law]] that we call the [[pleasure principle]] (and which is only the [[principle]] of [[displeasure]]) is very soon to create a [[barrier]] to all <i>jouissance</i>.  If I am enjoying myself a little too much, I begin to feel [[pain]] and I moderate my [[pleasure]]s.  The organism seems made to avoid too much <i>[[jouissance]]</i>.  Probably we would all be as quiet as oysters if it were not for this curious organization which forces us to disrupt the [[barrier]] of [[pleasure]] or perhaps only makes us [[dream]] of forcing and disrupting this barrier.  All that is elaborated by the [[subjective]] [[construction]] on the scale of the [[signifier]] in its relation to the [[Other]] and which has its root in [[language]] is only there to permit the full spectrum of [[desire]] to allow us to approach, to test, this sort of [[forbidden]] <i>[[jouissance]]</i> which is the only valuable [[meaning]] that is offered to our [[life]].
