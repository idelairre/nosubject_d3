NATURE OF THE LINGUISTIC SIGN<a></a></font><p></p></h3></center><font size="+1"><br>
<br>

</font><blockquote><blockquote><font size="+1">[Saussure introduces the structuralist point of view into
linguistics which is marked first of all by giving special relief to
the synchronic dimension in the study of language.  The
synchronic dimension is distinguished from the diachronic, that
is, historic.  The idea is that an account of the present meaning
of words and sentences, i.e. semantics,  can't be reduced to a
historical study.  This may seem obvious to us, but the study of
linguistic meaning prior to Saussure had been historical with
considerations of structure limited largely to a consideration of
grammar.  The idea is that meaning, or signification, depends on
the SYSTEM of language given by a number of laws of equilibrium
which constitute the relative systemic stability of linguistic
meaning at the moment when, in virtue of this system, one
speaks.  So we have the distinction between <i>la langue</i>  and <i> la
parole.</i>  Language is the articulated use of the system, <i>la langue</i>

in speech, <i>la parole.  </i>La langue is language minus la parole.  It is
difficult to overestimate the significance of Saussure's idea for
a whole generation of French thinkers.  For insofar as language
enters into the determination of a whole variety of social
phenomena, its effects as structure enter in as well.  Post
structuralist thinkers remain in debt to Saussure for however
dynamic and open-textured
structures come to be, one
can't go back to purely
historical modes of
interpretation.  The
structuring effects of
discourse, the agency of the
letter in Lacan's terms, must be taken into account.]</font></blockquote><p><font size="+1"><br>

     Some people regard language, when reduced to its elements, as<br>
a naming-process only‹a list of words, each corresponding to the<br>

thing that it names. For example:</font><p>
<font size="+1"><br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
     This conception is open to criticism at several points. It assumes<br>
that ready-made ideas exist before words (on this point, see below,<br>
p. 111); it does not tell us whether a name is vocal or psychological<br>

in nature (<i>arbor</i>, for instance, can be considered from either view-<br>
point); finally, it lets us assume that the linking of a name and a<br>
thing is a very simple operation‹an assumption that is anything<br>
but true. But this rather naive approach can bring us near the<br>
truth by showing us that the linguistic unit is a double entity, one<br>
formed by the associating of two terms<br><br>

     We have seen in considering the speaking-circuit (p. 11) that both
terms involved in the linguistic sign are psychological and are <br>

united in the brain by an assocative bond- This point must be<br>
emphasized.<br><br>

     The linguistic sign unites, not a thing and a name, but a concept<br>
and a sound-image.[l] The latter is not the material sound, a purely<br>
physical thing, but the psychological imprint of the sound, the<br>
impression that it makes on our senses. The sound-image is sensory,<br>
and if I happen to call it "material,"' it is only in that sense, and by<br>
way of opposing it to the other term of the association, the concept,<br>

which is generally more abstract.<br><br>

     The psychological character of our sound-images becomes ap-<br>
parent when we observe our own speech. Without moving our lips<br>
or tongue, we can talk to ourselves or recite mentally a selection of<br>
verse. Because we regard the words of our language as sound-<br>
images, we must avoid speaking of the "phonemes" that make up<br>
the words. This term, which suggests vocal activity, is applicable<br>
to the spoken word only, to the realization of the inner image in<br>

discourse. We can avoid that misunderstanding by speaking of the<br>
<i>sounds </i>and <i>syllables</i> of a word provided we remember that the<br>
names refer to the sound-image.<br><br>

     The linguistic sign is then a two-sided psychological entity that<br>
can be represented by the drawing:</font></p><p><font size="+1"><br>
<br>

<img src="saussure2.jpeg" height="0" width="0"><br><br>

     The two elements are intimately united, and each recalls the<br>
other. Whether we try to find the meaning of the Latin word <i>arbor</i><br>
or the word that Latin uses to designate the concept "tree," it is</font></p><p>
<font size="+1"><br>
<br>
<font size="-1">1. The term sound-image may seem to be too restricted inasmuch as beside<br>
the representation of the sounds of a word there is also that of its articulation,<br>

tbe muscular image of the phonational act. But for F. de Saussure language is<br>
essentially a depository, a thing received from without (see p. 13). The sound<br>
image is par excellence the natural representation of the word as a fact of<br>
potential language, outside any actual use of it in speaking. The motor side is<br>
thus implied or, in any event, occupies only a subordinate role with respect<br>
to the sound-image. [Ed.]</font></font></p><p>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
clear that only the associations sanctioned by that language appeal<br>
to us to conform to reality, and we disregard whatever others<br>
might be imagined.<br><br>

     Our definition of the linguistic sign poses an important question<br>
of terminology. I call the combination of a concept and a sound-<br>
image a <i>sign,</i> but in current usage the term generally designates<br>

only a sound-image, a word, for example <i>(arbor</i>, etc.). One tends<br>
to forget that arbor is called a sign only because it carries the con-<br>
cept "tree," with the result that the idea of the sensory part<br>
implies the idea of the whole.</font></p><p><font size="+1"><br>
<br>

  <img src="saussure3.jpeg" height="0" width="0"></font></p><p>
<font size="+1"><br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
     Ambiguity would disappear if the three notions involved here<br>
were designated by three names, each suggesting and opposing the<br>
others. I propose to retain the word <i>sign [signe] </i>to designate the<br>
whole and to replace <i>concept</i> and <i>sound-image</i> respectively by<br>

<i>signified
[signifié]</i> and
<i>signifier
[signifiant]</i>;
the last two
terms have<br>
the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them<br>
from each other and from the whole of which they are parts.  As<br>
regards <i>sign</i>, if I am satisfied with it, this is simply because I do not<br>
know of any word to replace it, the ordinary language suggesting<br>
no other.<br><br>

     The linguistic sign, as defined, has two primordial character-<br>
istics. In enunciating them I am also positing the basic principles of<br>
any study of this type.</font></p><p><font size="+1"><br>

<i>2. Principle 1: The Arbitrary Nature of the Sign</i><br><br>

     The bond between the signifier and the signified is arbitrary.<br>
Since I mean by sign the whole that results from the associating of<br>

the signifier with the signified, I can simply say: <i>the linguistic sign<br>
is arbitrary.</i><br><br>

     The idea of "sister" is not linked by any inner relationship to<br>
the succession of sounds <i>s-ö-r</i> which serves as its signifier in French;<br>
that it could be represented equally by just any other sequence is<br>
proved by differences among languages and by the very existence<br>

of different languages: the signified "ox" has as its signifier <i>b-ô-f</i><br>
on one side of the border and <i>o-k-s</i> (Ochs) on the other.<br><br>

     No one disputes the principle of the arbitrary nature of the sign,<br>
but it is often easier to discover a truth than to assign to it its<br>
proper place. Principle I dominates all the linguistics of language;<br>
its consequences are numberless. It is true that not all of them are<br>

equally obvious at first glance; only after many detours does one<br>
discover them, and with them the primordial importance of the<br>
principle.<br><br>

     One remark in passing: when semiology becomes organized as<br>
a science, the question will arise whether or not it properly includes<br>
modes of expression based on completely natural signs, such as<br>
pantomime. Supposing that the new science welcomes them, its<br>
main concern will still be the whole group of systems grounded on<br>

the arbitrariness of the sign. In fact, every means of expression used<br>
in society is based, in principle, on collective behavior or‹what<br>
amounts to the same thing‹on convention. Polite formulas, for<br>
instance, though often imbued with a certain natural expressive-<br>
ness (as in the case of a Chinese who greets his emperor by bowing<br>
down to the ground nine times), are nonetheless fixed by rule; it is<br>
this rule and not the intrinsic value of the gestures that obliges one<br>
to use them. Signs that are wholly arbitrary realize better than the<br>
others the ideal of the semiological process; that is why language,<br>

the most complex and universal of all systems of expression, is also<br>
the most characteristic; in this sense linguistics can become the<br>
master-pattern for all branches of semiology although language is<br>
only one particular semiological system.<br><br>

     The word <i>symbol</i> has been used to designate the linguistic sign,<br>
or more specifically, what is here called the signifier. Principle I in<br>

particular weighs against the use of this term. One characteristic<br>
of the symbol is that it is never wholly arbitrary; it is not empty,<br>
for there is the rudiment of a natural bond between the signifier<br>
and the signified. The symbol of justice, a pair of scales, could not<br>
be replaced by just any other symbol, such as a chariot.<br><br>

     The word <i>arbitrary</i> also calls ior commcnt. The term should not<br>

imply that the choice of the signifier is left entirely to the speaker<br>
(we shall see below that the individual does not have the power to<br>
change a sign in any way once it has become established in the<br>
linguistic community); I mean that it is unmotivated, i.e. arbitrary<br>
in that it actually has no natural connection with the signified.<br>
In concluding let us consider two objections that might be raised<br>
to the establishment of Principle I:<br><br>

     1) <i>Onomatopoeia</i> might be used to prove that the choice of the<br>

signifier is not always arbitrary. But onomatopoeic formations are<br>
never organic elements of a linguistic system. Besides, their number<br>
is much smaller than is generally supposed. Words like French<br>
<i>fouet</i> 'whip' or <i>glas</i> 'knell' may strike certain ears with suggestive<br>
sonority, but to see that they have not always had this property<br>
we need only examine their Latin forms (<i>fouet</i> is derived from <i>fagus</i><br>

'beech-tree,' <i>glas</i> from <i>classicum</i> 'sound of a trumpet'). The quality<br>
of their present sounds, or rather the quality that is attributed to<br>
them, is a fortuitous result of phonetic evolution.<br><br>

     As for authentic onomatopoeic words (e.g. glug~glug, tick-tock,<br>
etc.), not only are they limited in number, but also they are chosen<br>

somewhat arbitrarily, for they are only approximate and more or<br>
less conventional imitations of certain sounds (cf. English bo~boto<br>
and French ouaoua). In addition, once these words have been intro-<br>
duced into the language, they are to a certain extent subjected to<br>
the same evolution‹phonetic, morphological, etc.‹that other<br>
words undergo (cf. <i>pigeon</i>, ultimately from Vulgar Latin <i>pipio,</i><br>
derived in turn from an onomatopoeic formation): obvious proof<br>

that they lose something of their original character in order to<br>
assume that of the linguistic sign in general, which is unmotivated.<br><br>

     2) <i>Interjections</i>, closely related to onomatopoeia, can be at-<br>
tacked on the same grounds and come no closer to refuting our<br>
thesis. One is tempted to see in them spontaneous expressions of<br>
reality dictated, so to speak, by natural forces. But for most inter-<br>
jectlons we can show that there is no fixed bond between their sig-<br>

nified and their signifier. We need only compare two languages on<br>
this point to see how much such expressions differ from one lan-<br>
guage to the next (e.g. the English equivalent of French <i>aie!</i> is<br>
ouch!). We know, moreover, that many interjections were once<br>
words with specific meanings (cf. French <i>diable!</i> 'darn!' <i>mordieu!</i><br>

'golly!' from <i>mort Dieu</i> 'God's death,' etc.).'<br><br>

     Onomatopoeic formations and interjections are of secondary<br>
irnportance, and their symbolic origin is in part open to dispute.</font></p><p><font size="+1"><br>
<br>

3. <i>Principle II: The Linear Nature of the Signifier</i><br><br>

     The signifier, being auditory, is unfolded solely in time from<br>
which it gets the following characteristics: (a) it represents a span,<br>
and (b) the span is measurable in a single dimension; it is a line.<br>
While Principle II is obvious, apparently linguists have always<br>
neglected to state it, doubtless because they found it too simple;<br>
nevertheless, it is fundamental, and its consequences are incal-<br>
culable. Its importance equals that of Principle I; the whole<br>
mechanism of language depends upon it (see p. 122 f.). In contrast<br>

to visual signifiers (nautical signals, etc.) which can offer simul-<br>
taneous groupings in several dimensions, auditory signifiers have<br>
at their command only the dimension of time. Their elements are<br>
presented in succession; they form a chain. This feature becomes<br>
readily apparent when they are represented in writing and the<br>
spatial line of graphic marks is substituted for succession in time.<br><br>

     Sometimes the linear nature of the signifier is not obvious. When<br>
I accent a syllable, for instance, it seems that I am concentrating<br>

more than one significant element on the same point. But this is an<br>
illusion; the syllable and its accent constitute only one phonational<br>
act. There is no duality within the act but only different op-<br>
positions to what precedes and what follows (on this subject, see<br>
p. 131).</font></p><p><font size="+1"><br>
<br>

     IMMUTABILITY AND MUTABILITY OF THE SIGN</font></p><p><font size="+1"><br>

1.  <i>Immutability</i><br><br>

     The signifier, tbough to all appearances freely chosen with re-<br>
spect to the idea that it represcnts, iæ fixed, not free, with respect<br>
to the linguistic community that uses it. The masses have no voice<br>
in the matter, and the signifier chosen by language could be re-<br>
placed by no other. This fact, which seems to embody a contradic-<br>
tion, might be called colloquially "the stacked deck." We say to<br>
language: "Choose!" but we add: "It must be this sign and no<br>
other." No individual, even if he willed it, could modify in any<br>

way at all the choice that hag been made; and what is more, the<br>
community itself cannot control so much as a single word; it is<br>
bound to the existing language.<br><br>

     No longer can language be identified with a contract pure and<br>
simple, and it is precisely from this viewpoint that the linguistic<br>
sign is a particularly interesting object of study; for language<br>
furnishes the best proof that a law accepted by a community is a<br>
thing that is tolerated and not a rule to which all freely consent.<br>

Let us first see why we cannot control the linguistic sign and then<br>
draw together the important consequences that issue from the<br>
phenomenon.<br><br>

     No matter what period we chooge or how far back we go, lan-<br>
guage always appears as a heritage of the preceding period. We<br>
might conceive of an act by which, at a given moment, names were<br>
assigned to things and a contract was formed between concepts<br>
and sound-images; but such an act has never been recorded. The<br>

notion that things might have happened like that was prompted<br>
by our acute awareness of the arbitrary nature of the sign-<br><br>

     No society, in fact, knows or has ever known language other than<br>
as a product inherited from preceding generations, and one to be<br>
accepted as such. That is why the question of the origin of speech<br>
is not so important as it is generally assumed to be. The question<br>
is not even worth asking; the only real object of linguistics is the<br>
normal, regular life of an existing idiom. A particular language-<br>

state is always the product of historical forces, and these forces<br>
explain why the sign is unchangeable, i.e. why it resists any<br>
arbitrary substitution.<br><br>

     Nothing is explained by saying that language is something<br>
inherited and leaving it at that. Can not existing and inherited<br>
laws be modified from one moment to the next?<br><br>

     To meet that objection, we must put language into its social<br>

setting and frame the question just as we would for any other<br>
social institution. How are other social ingtitutions transmitted?<br>
This more general question includes the question of immutability.<br>
We must first determine the greater or lesser amounts of freedom<br>
that the other institutions enjoy; in each instance it will be seen<br>
that a different proportion exists between fixed tradition and the<br>
free action of society. The next step is to discover why in a given<br>
category, the forces of the first type carry more weight or less<br>
weight than those of the second. Finally, coming back to language,<br>

we must ask why the historical factor of transmission dominates it<br>
entirely and prohibits any sudden widespread change.<br><br>

     There are many possible answers to the question. For example,<br>
one might point to the fact that succeeding generations are not<br>
superimposed on one another like the drawers of a piece of furni-<br>
ture, but fuse and interpenetrate, each generation embracing in-<br>
dividuals of all ages‹with the result that modifications of language<br>
are not tied to the succession of generations. One might also recall<br>

the sum of the efforts required for learning the mother language<br>
and conclude that a general change would be impossible. Again,<br>
it might be added that reflection does not enter into the active use<br>
of an idiom‹speakers are largely unconscious of the laws of lan-<br>
guage; and if they are unaware of them, how could they modify<br>
them? Even if they were aware of these laws, we may be sure that<br>
their awareness would seldom lead to criticism, for people are<br>
generally satisfied with the language they have received.<br><br>

     The foregoing considerations are important but not topical. The<br>
following are more basic and direct, and all the others depend on<br>
them.<br><br>

     1) The arbitrary nature of the sign. Above, we had to accept the<br>
theoretical possibility of change; further reflection suggests that<br>
the arbitrary nature of the sign is really what protects language<br>
from any attempt to modify it. Even if people were more conscious<br>

of language than they are, they would still not know how to discuss<br>
it. The reason is simply that any subject in order to be discussed<br>
must have a reasonable basis. It is possible, for instance, to discuss<br>
whether the monogamous form of marriage is more reasonable than<br>
the polygamous form and to advance arguments to support either<br>
side. One could also argue about a system of symbols, for the sym-<br>
bol has a rational relationship with the thing signified (see p. 68);<br>
but language is a system of arbitrary signs and lacks the necessary<br>
basis, the solid ground for discussion. There is no reason for<br>

preferring <i>soeur</i> to <i>sister</i>, <i>Ochs</i> to <i>boeuf,</i> etc.<br><br>

     2) <i>The multiplicity of signs necessary to form any language.</i><br>

Another important deterrent to linguistic change is the great num-<br>
ber of signs that must go into the making of any language. A<br>
system of writing comprising twenty to forty letters can in case<br>
of need be replaced by another system. The same would be true<br>
of language if it contained a limited number of elements; but<br>
linguistic signs are numberless.<br><br>

     3) <i>The over-complexity of the system</i>. A language constitutes a<br>

system. In this one respect (as we shall see later) language is not<br>
completely arbitrary but is ruled to some extent by logic; it is<br>
here also, however, that the inability of the masses to transform<br>
it becomes apparcnt. The system is a complex mechanism that can<br>
be grasped only through reflection; the very ones who use it daily<br>
are ignorant of it. We can conceive of a change only through the<br>
intervention of specialists, grammarians, logicians, etc.; but ex-<br>
perience shows us that all such meddlings have failed.<br><br>

     4) <i>Collective inertia toward innovation</i>. Language‹and this con-<br>
sideration surpasses all the others‹is at every moment every-<br>
body's concern; spread throughout society and manipulated by it,<br>
language is something used daily by all. Here we are unable to set<br>
up any comparison between it and other institutions- The pre-<br>
scriptions of codes, religious rites, nautical signals, etc., involve<br>
only a certain number of individuals simultaneously and then only<br>

during a limited period of time; in language, on the contrary, every-<br>
one participates at all times, and that is why it is constantly being<br>
influenced by all. This capital fact suffices to show the impossibility<br>
of revolution. Of all social institutions, language is least amenable<br>
to initiative. It blends with the life of society, and the latter, inert<br>
by nature, is a prime conservative force.<br><br>

     But to say that language is a product of social forces does not<br>
suffice to show clearly that it is unfree; remembering that it is<br>

always the heritage of the preceding period, we must add that these<br>
social forces are linked with time. Language is checked not only by<br>
the weight of the collectivity but also by time. These two are in-<br>
separable. At every moment solidarity with the past checks free-<br>
dom of choice. We say <i>man</i> and <i>dog</i>. This does not prevent the<br>
existence in the total phenomenon of a bond between the two<br>

antithetical forces‹arbitrary convention by virtue of which choice<br>
is free and time which causes choice to be fixed. Because the sign<br>
is arbitrary, it follows no law other than that of tradition, and<br>
because it is based on tradition, it is arbitrary.</font></p><p><font size="+1"><br>

2. <i>Mutability</i><br><br>

     Time, which insures the continuity of language, wields another<br>
influence apparently contradictory to the first: the more or less<br>

rapid change ol linguistic signs. In a certain sense, therefore, we<br>
can speak of both the immutability and the mutability of the sign.'<br><br>

     In the last analysis, the two facts are interdependent: the sign<br>
is exposed to alteration because it perpetuates itself. What pre-<br>
dominates in all change is the persistence of the old substance;<br>
disregard for the past is only relative. That is why the principle<br>
of change is based on the principle of continuity.<br><br>

     Change in time takes many forms, on any one of which an im-<br>
portant chapter in linguistics might be written. Without entering<br>
into detail, let us see what things need to be delineated.<br>
First, let there be no mistake about the meaning that we attach<br>
to the word change. One might think that it deals especially with<br>
phonetic changes undergone by the signifier, or perhaps changes in<br>
meaning which affect the signified concept. That view would be<br>
inadequate. Regardless of what the forces of change are, whether<br>

in isolation or in combination, they always result in <i>a shift in the<br>
relationship between the signified and the signifer.</i><br><br>

     Here are some examples. Latin <i>necare</i> 'kill' became <i>noyer</i> 'drown'<br>
in French. Both the gound-image and the concept changed; but it<br>

is useless to separate the two parts of the phenomenon; it is<br>
sufficient to state with respect to the whole that the bond between<br>
the idea and the sign was loosened, and that there was a shift in<br>
their relationship. If instead of comparing Classical Latin <i>necare</i><br>
with French <i>noyer</i>, we contrast the former term with <i>necare</i> of<br>
Vulgar Latin of the fourth or fifth century meaning 'drown' the<br>

case is a little different; but here again; although there is no<br>
appreciable change in the signifier, there is a shift in the relation-<br>
ship between the idea and the sign.'<br><br>

     Old German <i>dritteil</i> 'one-third' became <i>Drittel</i> in Modern Ger-<br>
man. Here, although the concept remained the same, the relation-<br>

ship was changed in two ways: the signifier was changed not only<br>
in its material aspect but also in its grammatical form; the idea of<br>
<i>Teil</i> 'part' is no longer implied; <i>Drittel</i> is a simple word. In one way<br>
or another there is always a shift in the relationship.<br><br>

     In Anglo-Saxon the preliterary form <i>fot</i> 'foot' remained while its<br>

plural <i>foti</i> became <i>fet</i> (Modern English <i>feet</i>). Regardless of the<br>
other changes that are implied, one thing is certain: there was a<br>
shift in their relationship; other correspondenceg between the<br>
phonetic substance and the idea emerged.<br><br>

     Language is radically powerless to defend itself against the<br>
forces which from one moment to the next are shifting the relation-<br>
ship between the signified and the signifier. This is one of the<br>
consequences of the arbitrary nature of the sign.<br><br>

     Unlike language, other human institutions‹customs, laws, etc.<br>
‹are all based in varying degrees on the natural relations of things;<br>
all have of necessity adapted the means employed to the ends<br>

pursued. Even fashion in dress is not entirely arbitrary; we can<br>
deviate only slightly from the conditions dictated by the human<br>
body. Language is limited by nothing in the choice of means, for<br>
apparently nothing would prevent the associating of any idea<br>
whatsoever with just any sequence of sounds.<br><br>

     To emphasize the fact that language is a genuine institution,<br>
Whitney quite justly insisted upon the arbitrary nature of signs;<br>
and by so doing, he placed linguistics on its true axis. But he did<br>

not follow through and see that the arbitrariness of language radi-<br>
cally separates it from all other institutions. This is apparent from<br>
the way in which language evolves. Nothing could be more com-<br>
plex. As it is a product of both the social force and time, no one<br>
can change anything in it, and on the other hand, the arbitrariness<br>
of its signs theoretically entails the freedom of establishing just<br>
any relationship between phonetic substance and ideas. The result<br>
is that each of the two elements united in the sign maintains its<br>
own life to a degree unknown elsewhere, and that language<br>

changes, or rather evolves, under the influence of all the forces<br>
which can affect either sounds or meanings. The evolution is in-<br>
evitable; there is no example of a single language that resists it.<br>
After a certain period of time, some obvious shifts can always be<br>
recorded.<br><br>

     Mutability is so inescapable that it even holds true for artificial<br>
languages. Whoever creates a language controls it only so long as<br>
it is not in circulation; from the moment when it fulfills its mission<br>

and becomes the property of everyone, control is lost. Take Es-<br>
peranto as an example; if it succeeds, will it escape the inexorable<br>
law? Once launched, it is quite likely that Esperanto will enter<br>
upon a fully semiological life; it will be transmitted according to<br>
laws which have nothing in common with those of its logical cre-<br>
ation, and there will be no turning backwards. A man proposing<br>
a fixed language that posterity would have to accept for what it is<br>
would be like a hen hatching a duck's egg: the language created<br>
by him would be borne along, willy-nilly, by the current that<br>

engulfs all languages.<br><br>

     Signs are governed by a principle of general semiology: con-<br>
tinuity in time is coupled to change in time; this is confirmed by<br>
orthographic systems, the speech of deaf-mutes, etc.<br><br>

     But what supports the necessity for change? I might be re-<br>
proached for not having been as explicit on this point as on the<br>
principle of immutability. This is because I failed to distinguish<br>

between the different forces of change. We must consider their<br>
great variety in order to understand the extent to which they are<br>
necessary.<br><br>

     The causes of continuity are <i>a priori </i>within the scope of the<br>
observer, but the causes of change in time are not. It is better not<br>
to attempt giving an exact account at this point, but to restrict<br>
discussion to the shifting of relationships in general. Time changes<br>

all things; there is no reason why language should escape this<br>
universal law.<br><br>

     Let us review the main points of our discussion and relate them<br>
to the principles set up in the Introduction.<br><br>

     1) Avoiding sterile word definitions, within the total phenome-<br>
non represented by speech we first singled out two parts: language<br>
and speaking. Language is speech less speaking. It is the whole set<br>

of linguistic habits which allow an individual to understand and<br>
to be understood.</font></p><p><font size="+1"><br>

     2) But this definition still leaves language outside its social con-<br>
text; it makes language something artificial since it includes only<br>
the individual part of reality; for the realization of language, a<br>
community of speakers [<i>masse parlante</i>] is necessary. Contrary to<br>
all appearances, language never exists apart from the social fact,<br>

for it is a semiological phenomenon. Its social nature is one of its<br>
inner characteristics. Its complete definition confronts us with two<br>
inseparable entities, as shown in this drawing:</font></p><p>

<br>
     But under the conditions described language is not living--it<br>

has only potential life; we have considered only the social, not the<br>
historical, fact.<br><br>

     3) The linguistic sign is arbitrary; language, as defined, would<br>
therefore seem to be a system which, because it depends solely on a<br>
rational principle, is free and can be organized at will. Its social<br>
nature, considered independently, does not definitely rule out this<br>
viewpoint. Doubtless it is not on a purely logical basis that group<br>
psychology operates; one must consider everything that deflects<br>

reason in actual contacts between individuals. But the thing which<br>
keeps language from being a simple convention that can be modi-<br>
fied at the whim of interested parties is not its social nature; it is<br>
rather the action of time combined with the social force. If time<br>
is left out, the linguistic facts are incomplete and no conclusion<br>
is possible.<br><br>

     If we congidered language in time, without the community of<br>
speakers--imagine an isolated individual living for several cen-<br>

turies‹we probably would notice no change; time would not<br>
influence language. Conversely, if we considered the community<br>
of speakers without considering time, we would not see the effect<br>
of the social forces that influence language. To represent the actual<br>
facts, we must then add to our first drawing a sign to indicate<br>
passage of time:<br><br>

<br>
     Language is no longer free, for time will allow the social forces<br>

at work on it to carry out their effects. This brings us back to the<br>
principle of continuity, which cancels freedom. But continuity<br>
necessarily implies change, varying degrees of shifts in the relation<br>
ship between the signified and the signifier. <br>
