<blockquote>Ego's repression-resistance (that is, the unpleasure felt by it at undertaking the severe work imposed upon it).<ref>{{OoPA}} Ch. 6</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>The ego protects itself against the incursion of undesirable elements from the unconscious and repressed id by means of anti-cathexes, which must remain intact if it is to function normally. The more hardly the ego feels itself pressed, the more convlulsively it clings (in terror, as it were) to these anticathexes, in order to protect what remains of it from further irruptions .... The ego shrinks from undertakings that seem dangerous and threaten unpleasure; it must be constantly spurred on and soothed down if it is not to fail us. This resistance, which persists through the whole treatment and is renewed with every fresh piece of work, has been named, though not quite correctly, repression-resistance.<ref>{{OoPA}} Ch. 6</ref></blockquote>
