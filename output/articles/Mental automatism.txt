In the [[{{Y}}|late 1920s]], [[Lacan]] singled out his concept of "[[mental automatism]]".  This brought together many seemingly disparate phnomena of [[madness]] under the common motif of ''something being imposed from 'outside'.'': the echo of thoughts or a commentary on one's actions, for example.

The form of a particular [[psychosis]] would then be determined by how one ''[[signification|made sense]]'' of these elements which lacked an initial content.  [[Lacan]] would say that this concept was the closest that contemporary [[France|French]] [[psychiatry]] got to a [[structural analysis]], with its emphasis on the imposition of formal elements beyond the "[[conscious]]" [[control]] of the [[subject]].
