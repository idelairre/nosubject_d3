=====Enjoyment=====

''[[Ideology]] relies on an unassimilable kernel of [[enjoyment]]''.<ref>{{Z}} ''[[The Plague of Fantasies]]''. London: Verso, 1997. p. 50</ref>

This means [[subject]]s are attached to an [[ideology|ideological formation]] not simply because of a set of [[identification|identifiable]] [[cause|reasons]] or [[cause]]s but because of something [[surplus|extra]].

[[Ideology|Ideological formations]] rely on an extra, nonrational nugget that goes beyond what we [[knowledge|know]] to produce our sense of who we are and what the world is for us.

Again, the idea of enjoyment as a political fac­tor is that some contingent element of reality takes on a special, excessive role and so attaches us to a socio-political formation. 

In Zizek's words, this element "becomes elevated to the dignity of a Thing."

=====Ideological Formations=====

[[Enjoyment]] is a category that can help [[political theory|political theorists]] account for differences among [[ideology|ideological formations]]

Zizek differentiates among ideological formations in terms of [[enjoyment]].

A primary task for the political theorist, then, is to grasp how a given forma­tion organizes enjoyment.
