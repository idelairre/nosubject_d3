In the early 1970s, Lacan turned his attention more and more to the place of ''jouissance'' in human sexuality, the field he had discussed with such subtety in the late 1950s with the theoretical tools of [[desire]] and the [[phallus]].  Whereas [[language]] and ''[[jouissance]]'' had remained distinct in mot of his formulations until now, Lacan argued that '''there is a side to language which is itself a form of ''jouissance'''.  If language was traditionally seen as made up of [[signifier]]s, each of which was linked to another [[signifier]], he now proposed that there was a [[signifier]] without such links... a One, which makes up "[[lalangue]]", an amalgam of [[libido]] and [[signifier]]s.

[[Language]] is now shown to have not only effects of meaning and signification, but direct effects of ''[[jouissance]]''.  These ideas complicated the received notion that the [[libido]] and ''[[jouissance]]'' were different in nature from linguistic elements.
