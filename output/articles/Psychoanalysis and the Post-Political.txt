  An Interview with Slavoj Zizek

For many, Jacques Lacan represents postmodern theory at its height--that
is, at its worst. Lacan, so say his detractors, made a career out
of obscurantism, and may not even have believed very much of what he
said. Noam Chomsky once indicated such a hypothesis when he explained
that "my frank opinion is that [Lacan] was a conscious charlatan, and
he was simply playing games with the Paris intellectual community to
see how much absurdity he could produce and still be taken seriously."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

Even Lacanians might find it in their hearts to forgive Chomsky
 such a remark, since it was Chomsky who, after asking Lacan a question
 concerning thought (at the latter's 1968 presentation at MIT), received
 the reply, "We think we think with our brain; personally, I think with
 my feet. That's the only way I come into contact with anything solid. I
 do occasionally think with my forehead, when I bang into something."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 As if to condense the aura of contrariness and enigma he cultivated in
 such exchanges, Lacan often relayed his teachings through now-infamous
 maxims and mathemes, those Zen koans of the French postmodern era:
 "Desire is desire of the Other," "There is no sexual relation," "The
 Woman does not exist."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 No wonder Chomsky and many others turn their heads in exasperation.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">The best counterpoint to suspicions such as Chomsky's may well be found in
the work of Slavoj Zizek, whose frenetic endorsements of Lacanian theory
achieve a dense complexity even as they provide moments of startling
(and typically humorous) clarity. Take Zizek's way of explaining why
even one of the most banal features of late twentieth-century culture,
the laugh-track of situation comedy, is itself an illustration of the
Lacanian thesis that "desire is desire of the Other":

<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">. . . let us remind ourselves of a phenomenon quite usual in popular
television shows or serials: "canned laughter." After some supposedly
funny or witty remark, you can hear the laughter and applause included in
the soundtrack of the show itself--here we have the exact opposite of the
Chorus in classical tragedy; it is here that we have to look for "living
Antiquity." That is to say, why the laughter? The first possible
answer--that it serves to remind us when to laugh--is interesting enough,
since it implies the paradox that laughter is a


<b>[End Page 1]</b>

matter of duty and not of some spontaneous feeling; but this answer
is not sufficient because we do <i>not</i> usually laugh. The only
correct answer would be that the Other--embodied in the television set--is
relieving us even of our duty to laugh--is laughing instead of us. So
even if, tired from a hard day's stupid work, all evening we did nothing
but gaze drowsily into the television set, we can say afterwards that
objectively, through the medium of the Other, we had a really good time.

</font></blockquote>

<p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">Whimsical and yet theoretically earnest solutions to everyday conundrums
such as this can have the effect of seducing even Zizek's most skeptical
readers, but this is not to say that Zizek's work hasn't earned him
opponents. For many, Zizek's Lacanian analyses of contemporary culture
cannot quite shed the burdens of classical psychoanalysis itself:
in an academy happily enamored of historicism and often disinclined
toward universalisms of any kind, Zizek's mostly ahistorical,
psychoanalytic defense of the Enlightenment draws criticism from
various epistemological camps. One of the most persistent reproaches,
for instance, has been voiced by Judith Butler, who asks rhetorically,
"Can Zizekian psychoanalysis respond to the pressure to theorize
the historical specificity of trauma, to provide texture for the
specific exclusions, annihilations, and unthinkable losses that
structure . . . social phenomena . . . ?"
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Others have raised suspicions about the political implications of the
 Zizekian subject: "[Zizek] views the modern individual as caught
 in the dichotomy between his or her universal status as a member
 of civil society, and the particularistic attachments of ethnicity,
 nation and tradition, and this duality is reflected in his own
 ambiguous political profile--<i>marxisant</i> cultural critic on
 the international stage, member of a neo-liberal and nationalistically
 inclined governing party back home."

<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">I recently met with Zizek in order to discuss such complaints, as well
as to elicit his opinions on the ongoing crises in the ex-Yugoslavia,
Zizek's country of birth. The latter topic has become a heated
subject for Zizek, who ran a close campaign for the presidency of
Slovenia in 1990, and who views the resurgence of nationalism in the
Balkan states as a phenomenon that has gone completely misunderstood by
the West. Since the Bosnian conflict began near the outset of the
last decade, ex-Yugoslav politics have taken up more space in Zizek's
thinking, but still, there is probably no dominant feature within the
contemporary landscape he analyzes. For Zizek, one quickly realizes,
life is essentially an excuse to theorize; hence, his Lacanian commentary
on the psychopathology of everyday existence rarely ceases. As we packed
into a crowded elevator in New York's St. Moritz hotel, for instance, the
panel of control buttons caught Zizek's eye, provoking an excursus on
the faulty logic behind the hotel's symbolic exclusion of the thirteenth
floor. "You

<b>[End Page 2]</b>

cannot cheat God!" he proclaimed, drawing bewildered glances from the
people around us. "They shouldn't call it the fourteenth floor--they
should just make the thirteenth floor an empty mezzanine, an
ominous lack in the midst of the others." Somehow, the commentary slid
effortlessly, naturally, into the subject of voyeurism, and from there,
to the Lacanian distinction between the gaze and the look. Our later
conversation partook of a similar, free-associative pattern even as it
returned to a few fundamental concerns: the position of Lacanian theory
in today's academy, Zizek's friendly antagonism with Judith Butler,
Zizek's own polemic against multicultural identity politics. And talking
with Zizek, one realizes that these issues are all of a piece with a
larger problem: What kinds of political ontology--what manner of social
perception, for that matter--does today's theoretical constellation
allow or, more particularly, foreclose?

<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>Christopher Hanlon:</b> <i>Your home city, Ljubljana, is home to a
number of prominent Lacanians today. Was there something particular about
the Slovene--then the Yugoslav--scene that made Lacan particularly crucial
during the 1980s, when you were first formulating your project?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>Slavoj Zizek:</b> I believe it was simply some
incredible contingency. The first thing here is that, in the
ex-Yugoslavia, the phenomenon is strictly limited to Slovenia--there are
practically no Lacanians in the other Yugoslav republics. But I'm often
asked this question: "Why there?" The only thing I can say is that there
were some marginal, not-sufficient, negative conditions. One was that
the intellectual climate was very open; or rather, the regime was open if
you didn't directly pursue political opposition. There was intellectual
freedom, borders were open, and so on . . . . And the other thing was that
Slovenia was, far from being isolated from Europe, a kind of microcosm,
in the sense that all of what went on in the philosophical scene around
the world, all main orientations, were fairly represented. This is to
say, there was a clear Frankfurt School or Critical Theory orientation,
there was a Heideggerian orientation, there were analytical philosophers,
and so on and so on . . . . But within this constellation, I don't have
a precise theory, though it's something I'm often asked. Why there? One
thing is that in other areas--around Zagreb and Belgrade, in Croatia and
Serbia--they have much more substantial psychoanalytical traditions,
and maybe this is what prevented them from appropriating Lacan. In
Slovenia, there was no psychoanalytic tradition, so we were starting
from a zero-point.


</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">For me, the original spark came out of the confluence of
two traditions: Frankfurt School marxism and, of course, Lacanian
psychoanalysis. When I was a young student in Slovenia, the intellectual
scene

<b>[End Page 3]</b>

was divided between Heideggerians and the Frankfurt School. Under
Yugoslav Communism, that is, dialectical materialism was dead; it was no
longer the State philosophy. It was some kind of vague humanist marxism,
linked to the Frankfurt School. At least in Slovenia, the main opposition
was Heideggerrian: this is why my first book was on Heidegger and
language. But what made me suspicious was this phenomenon, as it seemed
to me, by which both Heideggerians and the followers of the Frankfurt
School began to speak the same language. This precisely aroused me.

role in your later work--say, from</i> The Metastases of Enjoyment <i>onward--American popular culture remains the central touchstone. Do you
see America as more pathological, more ripe for analysis?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> This is perhaps the result of my personal trauma,
which was that my relationship with Slovene art, especially with Slovene
literature and cinema, was extremely negative. In Slovenia we have a
cult of literature, especially poetry, as "the fundamental cornerstone
of our society"; the idea is that the Slovene poets effectively created
the Slovene nation, so there's a false veneration of poetry. On top of
it, most Slovene writers now are, in no uncertain terms, right-wing
nationalists, so I'm happily not on speaking terms with them--it's
a kind of negative gesture of pride for me to turn to American pop
culture. Although, in the last few years, I have been turning toward
so-called "literary" or high culture; my new book will deal with
Shklovsky, Tchaikovsky, and so on.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"> There have been some surprises here. For example, they
were worried about <i>The Ticklish Subject</i>. "After so many books,
who will buy such a thick book, 400 pages . . . ." But OK--I know that I
am very close to flooding the market; the next thing will be that
next month a short book on David Lynch's <i>Lost Highway</i> will come
out by the University of Washington Press, Seattle. Then it will be this
other book, this big triple-orgy, this dialogue, between Judith Butler,
Ernesto Laclau, and me. The idea was that each of us should write an
opening statement, maybe fifty pages, defining his or her
position toward the other two. Then two rounds of questions and answers;
it grew into a big book, about three hundred printed pages. And it's
very interesting to me, because it isn't a polite debate; it's nasty,
nasty--it almost but I hope didn't ruin our personal relationships. We're
really pretty good friends, but it does get

tone it down a little bit," and so on and so on.

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>I want to ask about one common critique of your work, most
recently voiced by James Hurley, that centers on what we might call your
"intrapsychic" focus.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 For you, of course, ideological coercion occurs at the libidinal level,
 at the constitutive level of a subject who "is" a disjunction between
 the Symbolic and the Real. But some commentators have expressed concern
 that this intrapsychic focus has the effect of leaving us little to do
 by way of intervening upon specifically institutional mechanisms
 of coercion. Do such objections concern you?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> No, because I think that such criticism misses the
point of Freudian subjectivity. I think that the very term "intrapsychic"
is misleading; I think that, at least for Lacan, who emphasizes this
again and again, the proper dimension of the unconscious is not "deep
inside." The proper dimension is outside, materialized in the state
apparatuses. The model of split subjectivity, as later echoed by Louis
Althusser, is not that there is something deep in me which is repressed;
it's not this internal psychic conflict. What subverts my conscious
attitudes are the implicit ideological beliefs externalized, embodied
in my activity. For instance, I'm interested in this new fashion of
Hollywood Holocaust comedy. Have you noticed how, starting with <i>Life Is
Beautiful</i>, we have a new genre, repeated in <i>Jakob the Liar</i>, and
so on? Apropos of this, I ask, "Why do Holocaust tragedies fail?" For me,
Speilberg is at his lowest during a scene from <i>Schindler's List</i>,
when the concentration-camp commander faces the Jewish girl and we
have this internal monologue, where he is split between his attraction
to the girl and his racist tract: you know, "Are you a rat? Are you a
human being?" and so on. I think this split is false. I take here quite
literally Lacan's dictum that psychoanalysis is not psychology, that the
ultimate lesson of psychoanalysis is that when you analyze phenomena
like Nazis or Stalinism, it is totally wrong to think that you will
arrive at any pertinent result through so-called in-depth profiles
of figures like Stalin or Hitler. Here there is a lesson to be
learned from Hannah Arendt--though at a different level I disagree with
her--about the banality of evil. The banality of evil means for me that
the key is not, for example, the personality of Eichmann; there is a gap
separating the acts of Eichmann from Eichmann's self-experience. But what
I would add is that this doesn't mean that Eichmann was simply innocent
in the sense that he was possessed by some kind of brutally objective
logic. My idea is more and more that we are dealing with--to reference
my eternal idea about canned laughter--what I am tempted to call a kind
of canned hatred. In the same way that the TV set laughs


<b>[End Page 5]</b>

for you, relieves you of the obligation to really laugh, Eichmann himself
didn't really have to hate the Jews; he was able to be just an ordinary
person. It's the objective ideological machinery that did the hating;
the hatred was imported, it was "out there."

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>He even reported that he admired the Jews, that he used to
literally vomit with disgust at the efficiency of the extermination
. . .</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> Yes! So again, I would say that this reproach misses
the point in the sense that the fundamental lesson of psychoanalysis
is that the unconscious is outside, crystallized in institutional
practices. This is why, for me, commodity fetishism is a nice example of
this--not collective, I'm not speaking of course about some Jungian
collective unconscious--unconscious in the sense of the set of
presuppositions, beliefs. The subject is not aware of these beliefs,
but the beliefs are materialized in the social practices, rituals,
institutions in which the subject participates. So in this sense, I claim
that this idea that when you analyze in psychoanalytic terms what are
ideological phenomena, you translate them into intrapsychic phenomena,
definitely does not hold for Lacan. If anything, Lacan can be accused
of the opposite mistake, of externalizing these issues. For example,
in a friendly discussion with him years ago, this is what Fred Jameson
reproached me with: that the inner self-experience disappears with me,
that I externalize everything into social rituals.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">Let me put it this way: Lacan is an author with which it's incredible
how "anything goes." It's incredible how whatever comes to our head,
you can attribute to Lacan--people are very insensitive to the things
Lacan actually says. OK, he's a difficult author, but nonetheless,
some of the things he says are formulated very clearly. Just to give you
an example: though I appreciate her very much--especially her late work,
<i>The Psychic Life of Power</i>--Judith Butler repeatedly makes this
strange claim, this strange thesis, that for us Lacanians (not for her),
"unconscious" is Imaginary resistance to the Symbolic Law. Where did she
find this? I'm almost tempted to say, "Wait a minute! If there is
one phrase that is the first commonplace about Lacan, the first
association, it is 'The unconscious is structured like a language'!" The
unconscious <i>is</i> the Symbolic order. Where did she find this
idea that the unconscious is Imaginary resistance? I know what she
means--her idea is that we are caught in the web of social relations
which are the Symbolic order, and that unconsciously, our resistance is
to identify with the set of social norms, and so on and so on. OK! An
interesting thesis, but unfortunately, it has <i>absolutely</i> nothing
to do with Lacan.

Dews, but I told him, "My God!" Where did he get that? Because the
irony is that in Slovenia, nationalists cannot stand me. In Slovenia,
I'm always attacked as a "national nihilist," a "cynicist," and so
on . . . . The idea that I'm a nationalist seems simply ridiculous to
me, a kind of propaganda. The catch is the following one: I come from
Slovenia, and for a lot of Western left-wingers, we Slovenes committed
the original sin. The idea is that we were the first ones to leave
Yugoslavia, that we started the process and then hypocritically escaped
the consequences. We stepped out when the house of cards was starting
to collapse, and started it all, and we didn't even suffer for it. It's
incredible how strong this accusation is. So Dews's big reproach is
"Why didn't you oppose the disintegration of Yugoslavia?" First, I was
pretty much indifferent to this at the time. But the thing that surprises
me about this is that--typically in England--the very same people who
are opposed to the disintegration of Yugoslavia, if you ask them about,
for instance, Ireland: all these principles are suddenly reversed. So
<i>that</i> is not nationalist madness?

to play that game, to present myself as this kind of victim. This is one
aspect. The other aspect is a general resistance to Lacan. Let's put it
this way: vaguely, we have three orientations today. For phenomenologists
or Heideggerians, Lacan is too eccentric, not to be taken seriously. For
Habermasians--though Dews is usually an exception here--Lacanians are some
kind of protofascists, irrationalists, whatever; basically, they prefer
not to enter into discussion with us. For example, in one of her last
articles, I saw Nancy Fraser make a line of distinction between Kristeva
and Lacan, claiming that Kristeva may be of some use, but that Lacan
can be of absolutely <i>no</i> use. . . . With deconstruction, it's the
same--you know, this incredible tension between Lacan and Derrida. Then,
of course, for cognitivists, Lacan is simply deconstruction. So all main
orientations definitely reject the Lacanian approach.

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>Well, apropos of this Habermas/Lacan division you mention

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> . . . But wait a minute--who stands for Lacan? I don't
think we are strong enough Lacanians to function as opposition. The
debate is usually either Habermas versus communitarians, who consider
Habermas too much of a universalist, or on the other hand Habermas
versus deconstructionists, who again question whether we need universal
norms. The point is . . . don't you think that for Habermasians we
rarely even enter the picture? The big debate is, for example in the
feminist circle, Nancy Fraser or Seyla Benhabib against Judith Butler,
against Wendy Brown--you have that opposition. Or deconstruction versus
neopragmatism--we simply do not enter the picture.

and more, to be between neopragmatists--I'm not thinking of Habermasians

couple of years ago, I saw Cornel West intone a kind of neopragmatist
complaint against you during a roundtable discussion: how do you justify
your highly abstract work, when there are concrete political battles to
be waged, and then call it liberal?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> Well, I don't think that . . . OK, Cornel West did
say that. But I nonetheless don't think that he perceives us as the
main opponent. Because this very reproach that you mention is not a
reproach that can be addressed specifically to Lacan. My idea
is the old marxist idea that this immediate reference to experience,
practice, struggle, etcetera, usually relies on the most abstract and
pure theory, and as an old philosopher I would say, as you said before,
that we simply cannot escape theory. I fanatically oppose this turn which
has taken place in social theory, this idea that there is no longer time
for great theoretical projects, that all we can do is narrativize the
experience of our suffering, that all various ethnic or sexual groups
can ultimately do is to narrate their painful, traumatic experience. I
think this is a catastrophe. I think that this fits perfectly the
existing capitalist order, that there is nothing subversive in it. I
think that this fits perfectly today's ideology of victimization,
where in order to legitimize, to gain power politically, you must present
yourself, somehow, as the victim.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">An anecdote of Richard Rorty's is of some interest to me here. You know
Rorty's thesis--and you know, incidentally, I like Rorty, because he
openly says what others won't. But Rorty once pointed out--I forget
where--how if you take big opponents, such as Habermas and Derrida,
and ask them how they would react to a concrete social problem, whether
to support this measure or that measure . . . . Are there any concrete
political divisions between Habermas and Derrida, although they cannot
stand each other? There are none! The same general left-of-center,
not-too-liberal but basically democratic vision . . . practically, their
positions are indistinguishable. Now, Rorty draws from this the conclusion
that philosophy doesn't matter. I am tempted to draw a more aggressive,
opposite conclusion: that philosophy <i>does</i> matter, but that
this political indifference signals the fact that although they appear
opposed, they actually share a set of presuppositions at the level of
their respective philosophies. Besides, not <i>all</i> philosophers would
adopt the same position; someone like Heidegger definitely would not,
and a left-winger like [Alain] Badiou definitely would not.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">The big question for me today concerns this new consensus--in England
it's the "third way," in Germany it's the "new middle"--this idea that
capitalism is here to stay, we can maybe just smooth it out a little with
multiculturalism, and so on . . . . Is this a new horizon or not? What
I appreciate in someone like Rorty is that at least he openly makes this
point. What annoys me about some deconstructionists is that they adopt

as their rhetorical post the idea that what they are doing is somehow
incredibly subversive, radical, and so on. But they do not render thematic
their own deep political resignation.

honed feel. Now, you suggest that partisans of the identity-politics
struggle have had a "depoliticizing" effect in some way. Could you hone
your comments even further? Do you mean that identity politics have come
to supersede what for you are more important antagonisms (such as that
between capital and democracy, for instance), or do you mean something
more fundamental, that politics itself has been altered for the worse?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> Definitely that it has been altered. Let me put
it this way: if one were to make this reproach directly, they would
explode. They would say, "My God, isn't it the exact opposite? Isn't
it that identity politics politicized, opened up, a new domain,
spheres of life that were previously not perceived as the province
of politics?" But first, this form of politicization nonetheless
involves a transformation of "politics" into "cultural politics," where
certain questions are simply no longer asked. Now, I'm not saying that
we should simply return to some marxist-fundamentalist essentialism,
or whatever. I'm just saying that . . . my God, let's at least just
take note of this, that certain questions--like those concerning the
nature of relationships of production, whether political democracy is
really the ultimate horizon, and so on--these questions are simply no
longer asked. And what I claim is that this is the necessary consequence
of postmodern identity politics. You cannot claim, as they usually do,
that "No, we don't abandon those other aspects, we just add to politics
proper." No, the abandonment is always implicit. Why? Take a concrete
example, like the multitude of studies on the exploitation of either
African Americans or more usually illegal Mexican immigrants who work
as harvesters here in the U.S. I appreciate such studies very much,
but in most of them--to a point at least--silently, implicitly, economic
exploitation is read as the result of intolerance, racism. In Germany,
they don't even speak of the working class; they speak of immigrants . . .

</font></p><p align="justify">

that the economic aspect of power is an expression of intolerance. The
fundamental problem then becomes "How can we tolerate the other?" Here,

<b>[End Page 10]</b>

we are dealing with a false psychologization. The problem is not that
of intrapsychic tolerance, and so I'm opposed to this way in which all
problems are translated into problems of racism, intolerance, etcetera. In
this sense, I claim that with so-called postmodern identity politics,
the whole concept of politics has changed, because it's not <i>only</i>
that certain questions aren't any longer asked. The moment you begin to
talk about . . . what's the usual triad? "Gender . . ."

multiple antagonisms coexisting, etcetera . . .

</font></p><p align="left">

the great premium you place on the "Lacanian act," the gesture that

of such an act? In culture or politics, is there some instance of an
authentic Lacanian act that we can turn toward?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> [...] You've got me here, in that sense. But I'm
not mystifying the notion of act into some big event . . . . What I'm
saying is that the way the political space is structured today more
and more prevents the emergence of the act. But I'm not thinking of
some metaphysical event--once I was even accused of conceiving of some
protofascist, out-of-nowhere intervention. For me, an act is simply
something that changes the very horizon in which it takes place, and I
claim that the present situation closes the space for such acts.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">We could even draw the pessimist conclusion--and though he doesn't

say so publicly, I know privately that Alain Badiou tends to this
conclusion--that maybe politics, for some foreseeable time, is no longer
a domain where acts are possible. That is, there were times during which
acts did happen--the French Revolution, the October Revolution, maybe the
'68 uprisings.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">I can only say what will have been an act: something which would break
this liberal consensus, though of course not in a fascist way. But
otherwise, there are examples from culture, from individuals' experiences;
there are acts all around in this sense. The problem for me is that in
politics, again, the space for an act is closing viciously.

<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>Let's move on to another topic. I have to ask you about your
reaction to what may be Derrida's last word on his whole conflict
with Lacan, published in</i> Resistances to Psychoanalysis. <i>Without
retracting any of his original theses concerning Lacan's seminar on "The
Purloined Letter," Derrida now insists that "I loved him and admired
him a lot," and also that "Not only was I not criticizing Lacan, but I
was not even writing a sort of overseeing or objectifying metadiscourse</i> on <i>Lacan,</i>" <i><sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

 that it was all part of a mutual dialogue . . . . What</i> is <i>your
 response to this?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> I would just like to make two points. First, I still
think, as I first developed in <i>Enjoy Your Symptom!</i>, that
"resistance" is the appropriate term here. In deconstructionist circles,
you can almost feel it, this strong embarrassment about Lacan. So
they can buy Lacan only, as it were, conditionally, only insofar as
they can say he didn't go far enough. I claim that the truth is the
exact opposite; the only way they can appropriate Lacan is to submit
him to a radical misreading. You know, all the time we hear about the
"phallic signifier," and so on, and so on, but the figure of
Lacan they construct is precisely what Lacan was trying to undermine. For
example, one of the standard criticisms of some deconstructionists here
in the States is that Lacan elevates the "Big Other" into some kind
of non-historical, a priori symbolic order . . . . My only, perhaps
naïve answer to this is that the big Lacanian thesis from the
mid-fifties is that "The Big Other doesn't exist." He repeats
this again and again, and the point of this is precisely that there is
no symbolic order that would serve as a kind of prototranscendental
guarantor. My second point would be a very materialist, Althusserian
one. Without reducing the theoretical aspects of this conflict,
let's not forget that academia is itself an "Ideological State Apparatus,"
and that all these orientations are not simply theoretical orientations,
but what's in question is thousands of posts, departmental politics,
and so on. Lacanians are excluded from this. That is to say, we are not
a field. You know, Derrida has his own empire, Habermasians have
their own

<b>[End Page 12]</b>

empire--dozens of departments, all connected--but with Lacanians, it's
not like this. It's maybe a person here, a person there, usually marginal
positions. So I think we should never underestimate this aspect.


</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">I think it would be much nicer, in a way, if Derrida said the opposite:
not that "I really hated him," but "there is a tension; we are
irreducible to each other." This statement you point out is the kiss
of death. What's the message in this apparently nice statement from
Derrida? The message is that "the difference is really not so strong,
so that our field, deconstruction, can swallow all of this; it's
really an internal discussion." I think it is not. I'm not even saying
who's right; I'm just claiming--and I think this is more important
than ever to emphasize--the tension between Derrida and Lacan and their
followers is not an interfamilial struggle. It's a struggle between two
radically different global perceptions. Even when they appear to use
approximately the same terms, refer to the same orders, they do it in a
totally different way, and this is why all attempts to mediate between
them ultimately fall short. Once, I was at a conference at Cardozo Law
School where Drucilla Cornell maintained that the Lacanian Real was a good
"first attempt" at penetrating beyond this ahistorical Symbolic
order, but that it also retains this dimension of otherness that is
still defined through the Symbolic order, and that the Derridean
notion of writing incorporates this otherness into the Symbolic order
itself more effectively, much more radically, so that the "real Real"
lies with Derrida's <i>écriture</i>, Lacan's "Real" is still under
the dimension of the metaphysical-logocentric order, and so on. This is
typical of what I'm talking about. We should simply accept that there
is no common language here, that Lacan is no closer to Derrida than to
Hegel, than to Heidegger, than to whomever you want.

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>Judith Butler--with whom you have engaged in ongoing if
cordial debate--maintains that the Lacanian topology is itself dubious
for its nonhistorical, transcultural presuppositions. You yourself have
written that "jouissance is non-historical</i>" <i><sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
--How do you respond to complaints such as Butler's?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> Ah! This is what we are struggling with for dozens,
maybe hundreds of pages, in this book. My answer is to say that <i>she</i>

is non-historical. That is to say, she presents a certain narrative,
the same as Ernesto [Laclau]. With Ernesto, it's that we have an older
type of essentialist class politics, then slowly, slowly, essentialism
starts to disintegrate, and now we have this contingent struggle for
hegemony where everything is open to negotiation . . . . With Judith
Butler, there is the same implicit narrative: in the old times, there
was sex essentialism, biologically-identified; then slowly, slowly,
this started disintegrating into a sex/gender distinction, the awareness
that gender is not biologically--

<b>[End Page 13]</b>

but rather culturally--constructed; finally, we come to this
performativity, contingency, and so on and so on. So the same story,
from essentialist zero-point to this open contingency where we have
struggles for hegemony which are undecided. My first reproach as
a philosopher to this is that here, some metanarrative is missing. To
ask a very stupid, naïve question: why were people one hundred and
fifty years ago essentialists? Were they simply stupid? You know
what I mean? There is a certain, almost teleological narrative here,
in which from the "bad" zero-point of essentialism, slowly we come to
the "good" realization that everything is a performative effect, that
nothing is exempted from the contingent struggle for hegemony. But don't
you need a metanarrative if you want to avoid the conclusion that people
were simply stupid one hundred and fifty years ago?

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>Well, perhaps not a metanarrative in the sense of a guiding
historical trajectory, but an acceptance of a loosely Foucauldian premise,

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> Ah! But if you accept this Foucauldian metanarrative,
then things get a little complicated. Because Foucault is not speaking
about truth-value; for him, it is simply the change from one episteme to
another. Then . . . OK, I ask you another question--let's engage in this
discussion, with you as Butler. So: is there a truth-value distinction
between essentialism and the performativity of gender or is it simply
the passage from one episteme to another? What would you say?

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>I won't speak for Butler, but if I were a Foucauldian,
I would say that the latter is the case, though I may prefer the later
episteme in light of my own political objectives.</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> Yeah, but Butler would never accept that.

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>You don't think so?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> You think she would? Because I think that the
epistemic presupposition of her work is implicitly--even explicitly,
at least in her early work--that, to put it bluntly, sex always already
was a performative construction. They just didn't know it then. But
you cannot unite this with Foucauldian narrative, because Foucauldian
narrative is epistemologically neutral, in which we pass from one
paradigm to the other. You know, sex was confessionary then; sex is
now post-confessionary, pleasurable bodies, whatever . . . . But OK:
Foucault would be one possible

<b>[End Page 14]</b>

metanarrative. Marxism would provide the other one, in the sense that
"the development of capitalism itself provoked a shift in subjectivity,"
whatever. But again, what I claim is that there is some unresolved
tension concerning historicity and truth-value.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">I ask you a different question. Both in Laclau and in Butler, there
is a certain theory: Butler--and I'm speaking of early Butler; later,
things get much more complex, much more interesting, a more intense
dialogue becomes possible . . .

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>So we're talking about</i> Gender Trouble, <i>parts of</i>
Bodies That Matter . . .

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> Yeah, I'm talking about <i>Gender Trouble</i>

with Butler, and about <i>Hegemony and Socialist Strategy</i> with
Laclau. Why? Because let's not forget that these two books were the
only two authentic "big hits" of the time. . . . I'll tell you why:
both <i>Gender Trouble</i> and <i>Hegemony and Socialist Strategy</i>
were read as a model for a certain political practice. With <i>Gender
Trouble</i>, the idea was that performativity and drag politics could have
a political impact; it was, to put it in naïve, Leninist terms, "a
guideline for a certain new feminist practice." It was programmatic. It
was the same with <i>Hegemony and Socialist Strategy</i>. It was
a justification for the abandonment of so-called essentialist
class politics, after which no specific struggle takes priority,
we just have to coordinate our practices, cultivate a kind of "rainbow
coalition," although Ernesto rejects the term . . . . Now, what are these
theories? Are they universal theories--of gender or of social/political
processes--or are they specific theories about political practice,
sex practice, within a certain historical/political moment? I claim that
the ambiguity is still irreducible. At the same time that it's clear that
these theories are rooted in a certain historical moment, it's also clear
that they touch upon a universal dimension. Now my ironic conclusion
is that, with all this anti-Hegelianism, what both Ernesto and Judith
do here is the worst kind of pseudo-Hegelian historicism. At a certain
point, it's as if the access to truth or what always already was true
is possible only in a certain historical situation. So in other words,
philosophically, I claim that beneath these theories of contingency,
there is another narrative that is deeply teleological.

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>But either Butler or Laclau might rebut this reproach by
pointing out that even such an embedded teleology is no worse than a
matrix of non-historical Lacanian presuppositions.</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> But my God, this is the big misunderstanding with
her! Butler systematically conflates what she calls "Real" with
some nonhistorical

<b>[End Page 15]</b>

symbolic norm. It's interesting how, in order to qualify the Lacanian
notion of sexual difference as a nonhistorical Real, she silently slips
in this nonhistorical gender norm, to then claim that "we homosexuals
are excluded from this," and so on. So her whole criticism inveighs
against this notion that Lacan thinks of sexual difference as part
of a nonhistorical, heterosexual normativity, and that this is what
should be subverted . . . . Of course, my counterpoint is that "Real,"
for Lacan, is the exact opposite. "Real" is that on account of which
every norm is undermined. When [Butler] speaks of historicity, my point
is not that there is something nonhistorical which precedes us. My
point is that the Lacanian Real, in a way, <i>is</i> historical,
in the sense that each historical epoch, if you will, has its own
Real. Each horizon of historicity presupposes some foreclosure of
some Real. Now, Judith Butler would say "OK, I agree with this, but
doesn't this mean that we should re-historicize the Real, include it,
re-negotiate it?" No, the problem is more radical . . . . Maybe the
ultimate misunderstanding between us--from my perspective--is that for
her, historicity <i>is</i> the ultimate horizon. As an old-fashioned
Freudian, I think that historicity is always a certain horizon which
has to be sustained on the basis of some fundamental exclusion. Why is
there historicity? Historicity doesn't simply means that "things change,"
and so on. That's just stupid evolutionism; not in the biological sense,
but common sense. Historicity means that there must be some unresolved
traumatic exclusion which pushes the process forward. My paradox would
be that if you take away the nonhistorical kernel, you lose history
itself. And I claim that Judith Butler herself, in her last book, is
silently approaching this position. Because in <i>Gender Trouble</i>,
the idea that your psychic identity is based on some primordial loss
or exclusion is anathema; it's the Big Bad Wolf. But have you noticed
that, if you read it closely, in <i>The Psychic Life of Power</i> she
now accepts this idea of a primordial loss when she speaks of these
"disavowed attachments"? The idea is now that we become subjects only
through renouncing the fundamental passionate attachment, and that there's
no return, no re-assumption of the fundamental attachment. It's a very
Freudian notion. If you lose the distance, the disavowal . . . it's
psychosis, foreclosure.


</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">The big problem I have with this shift is that it's a very refined
political shift of accent. What I don't quite accept in her otherwise
remarkable descriptions is how, when she speaks about the "marginalized
disavowed," she always presupposes--to put it in very naïve
terms--that these are the good guys. You know: we have Power, which wants
to render everything controllable, and then the problem is how to give
voice to those who are marginalized, excluded . . .

I'm aiming at is . . . aren't racist, anti-Semitic pogroms also
Bakhtinian carnival? That's to say that what interests me is not so
much the progressive other whom the power is controlling, but the way
in which power has to disavow its own operation, has to rely on its
own obscenity. The split is in the power itself. So that . . . when
Butler argues very convincingly against--at least she points to the
problematic aspects of--legal initiatives that would legalize gay
marriages, claiming that in this way, you accept state authority,
you become part of the "visible," you lose solidarity with all those
whose identity is not publicly acknowledged . . . I would say, "Wait a
minute! Is there a subject in America today who defines himself
as marginalized, repressed, trampled by state authority?" Yes! They
are called survivalists! The extreme right! In the United States,
this opposition between public state authority and local, marginalized
resistances is more and more an opposition between civil society and
radical right-wing groups.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">I'm not saying we should <i>simply</i> accept the state. I'm just
saying that I am suspicious of the political pertinence of this
opposition between the "public" system of power which wants to control,
proscribe everything, and forms of resistance to subvert it. What I'm
more interested in are the obscene supplements that are inherent to
power itself.

your decision to support the ruling party in Slovenia?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> No, no . . . that was a more specific phenomenon,
a very naïve one. What happened was that, ten years ago, the danger
in Slovenia was the same as in all the post-Communist countries. Would
there emerge one big, hegemonic, nationalist movement that would then
colonize practically the entire political space, or not? That was the
choice. And by making some compromises, we succeeded. In Slovenia,
the scene is totally different than in other post-Communist countries,
in the sense that we don't have--as in Poland, as in Hungary--the big
opposition is not between radical, right-wing, nationalist movements
and ex-Communists. The strongest political party in Slovenia is neither
nationalistic, nor ex-Communist . . . it was worth it. I'm far from
idealizing Slovenia, but the whole scene is nonetheless much more
pluralistic, much more open. It wasn't a Big Decision; it was just
a very modest, particular gesture with a specific aim: how to
prevent Slovenia from falling into the Serb or Croat trap, with one big
nationalist movement that controls the

space? How also to avoid the oppositions I mention that define the
political space of Hungary and Poland?

<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>Could we talk about Kosovo? In</i> The Metastases of
Enjoyment, <i>when the Bosnian conflict was still raging, you
insisted that the West's inability to act was rooted in its fixation

Balkan subject</i> as <i>victim. More recently, when the NATO bombings
were under way, you claimed that the act came much too late. Now, the

<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> . . . which will not happen, I think. Let me end up
with a nice provocation: the problem for me is this abstract pacifism
of the West, which renders publicly its own inability to act. What do
I mean by this? For the West, practically everything that happens in
the Balkans is bad. When the Serbs began their dirty work in Kosovo,
that was of course bad. When the Albanians tried to strike back, it was
also bad. The possibility of Western intervention was also bad, and so
on and so on. This abstract moralism bothers me, in which you deplore
everything on account of . . . what? I claim that we are dealing here with
the worst kind of Nietzschean ressentiment. And again, we encounter here
the logic of victimization at its worst, exemplified by a <i>New
York Times</i> piece by Steven Erlanger.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 He presented the crisis in terms of a "truly human perspective" on
 the war, and picked up an ordinary [Kosovar] Albanian woman who said,
 "I don't care who wins or who loses; I just want the nightmare to end;
 I just want peace; I want to feel good again. . . ." This, I claim, is
 the West's ideal subject--not a conscious political fighter, but
 this anonymous victim, reduced to this almost animal craving . . . as
 if the ultimate political project is to "feel good again."

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>In other words, a subject who has no stake in whether
Kosovo gains independence or not . . .</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> No stake, just this abstract suffering . . . and this
is the fundamental logic, that the [Kosovar] Albanians were good <i>so
long</i> as they were suffering. Remember the images during the war, of
the Albanians coming across the mountains, fleeing Kosovo? The moment
they started to strike back--and of course there are Albanian excesses;
I'm not idealizing them in this sense--they become the "Muslim danger,"
and so on. So it's clear that the humanitarian interventions of the West
are formulated in terms of this atmosphere of the protectorate--the
underlying idea is that these people are somehow not mature enough to
run their lives. The West should come and organize things for them, and of

<b>[End Page 18]</b>

course the West is surprised if the local population doesn't find
such an arrangement acceptable.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">Let me tell you a story that condenses what I truly believe here. About
a year and a half ago, there was an Austrian TV debate, apropos of
Kosovo, between three different parties: a Green pacifist, a Serb
nationalist, and an Albanian nationalist. Now, the Serb and the Albanian
talked--of course within the horizon of their political projects--in
pretty rational terms: you know, the Serb making the claim that Kosovo
was, for many centuries, the seat of the Serbian nation, blah, blah,
blah; the Albanian was also pretty rational, pointing out that since
they constitute the majority, they should be allowed self-determination,
etcetera. . . . Then the stupid Green pacifist said, "OK, OK,
but it doesn't matter what you think politically--just promise me
that when you leave here, you will not shoot at each other, that you
will tolerate each other, that you will <i>love</i> each other." And
then for a brief moment--that was the magic moment--I noticed how,
although they were officially enemies, the Albanian and the Serb
exchanged glances, as if to ask, "What's this idiot saying? Doesn't he
get it?" My idea is that the only hope in Kosovo is for the two of them
to come together and say something like the following: "Let's shoot the
stupid pacifist!" I think that this kind of abstract pacifism,
which reformulates the problem in the terms of tolerance . . . My God,
it's not tolerance which is the problem! This is what I hate so much
apropos of Western interventionism: that the problem is always rephrased
in terms of tolerance/intolerance. The moment you translate it into this
abstract proposition which--again, my old story--<i>depoliticizes</i>

the situation, it's over.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">Another aspect I want to emphasize apropos of Serbia: here, my
friend/enemy, a Serb journalist called Alexander Tijanic, wrote
a wonderful essay examining the appeal of Milosevic for the Serb
people. It was practically--I wondered if I could have paid him to make my
point better. He said that the West which perceives Milosevic as a kind
of tyrant doesn't see the perverse, liberating aspect of Milosevic. What
Milosevic did was to open up what even Tijanic calls a "permanent
carnival": nothing functions in Serbia! Everyone can steal! Everyone can
cheat! You can go on TV and spit on Western leaders! You can kill! You can
smuggle! Again, we are back at Bakhtin. All Serbia is an eternal carnival
now. This is the crucial thing people do not get here; it's not simply
some kind of "dark terror," but a kind of false, explosive liberation.

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>Do you see a viable political entity in Serbia that might
alter this?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> I can give you a precise answer in the guise of a
triple analysis. I am afraid the answer is no. There are three options
for Serbia: one

<b>[End Page 19]</b>

possibility is that Milosevic's regime will survive, but the country
will be isolated, ignored, floating in its own shit, a pariah. That's
one option. Another option that we dream about is that, through mass
demonstrations or whatever, there will be "a new beginning," a new
opening in the sense of a Western-style democratic upheaval. . . .

<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 But I think, unfortunately, that what will probably happen if Milosevic
 falls will be what I am tempted to call the "Russia-fication" of
 Serbia. That is to say, if Milosevic falls, a new regime will take
 over, which will consist of basically the same nationalists who are
 now in power, but which will present itself to the West--like Yeltsin
 in Russia--as open, and so on. Within Serbia, they will play the same
 corrupt games that Yeltsin is now playing, so that the same mobsters,
 maybe even another faction of the mafia, will take over, but they
 will then blackmail the West, saying that "If you don't give us economic
 help, all of these nationalists will take over . . . ."

</font></p><p align="left">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>CH:</b> <i>The "democratic resistance" in Serbia, in fact, is also
deeply nationalistic, right?</i>

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1"><b>SZ:</b> Of course! What you don't get often through the Western
media is this hypocritical . . . for instance, when there was a clash
between the police and anti-Milosevic demonstrators, you know what the
demonstrators were shouting? "Why are you beating us? Go to Kosovo and
beat the Albanians!" So much for the "Serb Democratic Opposition"! Their
accusation against Milosevic is not that he is un-democratic, though
it's also that: it's "You lost Bosnia! You lost Kosovo!" So I fear the
advent of a regime that would present itself to the West as open and
democratic, but will play this covert game. When pressed by the West to
go further with democratic reforms, they will claim that they are under
pressure from radical right-wing groups.

</font></p><p align="justify">
<font ,="" helvetica="" face="arial" size="-1">So I don't think there will be any great transformation. Now that
the Serbs have lost Kosovo, I don't think there will be another great
conflict, but neither do I think there will be any true solution. It
will just drag on--it's very sad.
