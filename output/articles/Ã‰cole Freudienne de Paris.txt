The [[École Freudienne de Paris]] ([[École Freudienne de Paris|EFP]]) was a [[French]] [[psychoanalytic]] [[school]] founded by [[Jacques Lacan]] on 12 June 1964, 

following the unsuccessful attempt by the [[Société Française de Psychanalyse]] ([[SFP]]) to affiliate to the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] ([[IPA]]) .

The [[SFP]] divided into those willing to recognize the condition laid down by the [[IPA]] -- the exclusion of [[Lacan]] from the training program, and those who regrouped around [[Lacan]].


after years of dispute with the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] over the (analytic practice) methods he used in his [[training|training analyses]].

==History of the EFP==
In 1969, a group disputing the [[EFP]]'s accreditation process broke away to form the [[Organisation psychanalytique de langue française]], also known as the "Quatrième Groupe" (the Fourth Group).

In January 1980 [[Lacan]] announced the dissolution of the [[École Freudienne de Paris|EFP]]. 


The [[École Freudienne de Paris|EPP]] was unilaterally dissolved by [[Lacan]] in 1980.
