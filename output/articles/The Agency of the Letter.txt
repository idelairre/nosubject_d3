Although the nature of this contribution was determined by the theme<br>
of the third volume of <i>La Psychanalyse,</i> I owe to what will be found<br>
there to insert it at a point somewhere between writing (l'écrit) and<br>
speech - it will be half-way between the two.<br><br>
Writing is distingiushed by a prevalence of the text in the sense that<br>

this factor of discourse will assume in this essay a factor that makes<br>
possible the kind of tightening up that I like in order to leave the reader<br>
no other way out than the way in, which I prefer to be difficult. In that<br>
sense, then, this will not be writing.<br><br>
Because I always try to provide my seminars each time with some.<br>
thing new, I have refirained so far from giving such a text, with one exception, which is not particularly outstanding in the context of the series,<br>
and which I refer to at all only for the general level of its argument.<br>
<br>
For the urgency that I now take as a pretext for leaving aside such an<br>

aim only masks the difficulty that, in trying to maintain it at the level at<br>
which I ought to present my teaching here, I might push it too far from<br>
speech, whose very different techniques are essential to the formative<br>
effect I seek<br>
.<br>
That is why I have taken the expedient offered me by the invitation<br>
to lecture to the philosophy group of the <i>Fédération des étudiants dès<br>
lettres</i> to produce an adaptation suitable to what I have to say: its necessary generality matches the exceptional character of the audience, but its<br>

sole object encounters the collusion of their common training, a literary<br>
one, to which my title pays homage.<br>
<br>
Indeed, how could we forget that to the end of his days Freud con-<br>
stantly maintained that such a training was the prime requisite in the<br>
formation of analysts, and that he designated the eternal <i>universitas<br>
litterarum</i> as the ideal place for its institution.<br><br>
Thus my recourse (in rewriting) to the movement of the (spoken)<br>

discourse, restored to its vitality, by showing whom I meant it for,<br>
marks even more clearly those for whom it is not intended.<br><br>
I mean that it is not intended for those who, for any reason whatever,<br>
in psychoanalysis, allow their discipline to avail itself of some false<br>
identity - a fault of habit, but its effect on the mind is such that the true<br>
identity may appear as simply one alibi among others, a sort of refined<br>
reduplication whose implications will not be lost on the most subtle minds.<br><br>
So one observes with a certain curiosity the beginnings of a new direc-<br>
tion concerning symbolization and language in the <i>Internationl Journal<br>

of Psychoanalysis</i>, with a great many sticky fingers leafing through the<br>
pages of Sapir and Jespersen. These exercises are still somewhat un-<br>
practised, but it is above all the tone that is lacking. A certain'seriousness'<br>
as one enters the domain of veracity cannot fail to raise a smile.<br><br>
And how could a psychoanalyst of today not realize that speech is the<br>
key to that truth, when his whole experience must find in speech alone<br>
its instrument, its context, its material, and even the background noise<br>
of its uncertainties.<br>

<br>
As my title suggests, beyond this 'speech', what the psychoanalytic ex-<br>
petience discovers in the unconscious is the whole structure of language.<br>
Thus from the outset I have alerted informed minds to the extent to<br>
which the notion that the unconscious is merely the seat of the instincts<br>
will have to be rethought.<br><br>
But how are we to take this 'letter' here? Quite simply, literally.<br><br>
By 'letter' I designate that materia1 support that concrete discourse<br>

borrows from language.<br><br>
This simple definition assumes that language is not to be confused<br>
with the various psychical and somatic functions that serve it in the<br>
speaking subject - primarily because language and its structure exist<br>
prior to the moment at which each subject at a certain point in his mental<br>
development makes his entry into it.<br><br>
Let us note, then, that aphasias, although caused by purely anatomical<br>
lesions in the cerebral apparatus that supplies the mental centre for these<br>
functions, prove, on the whole, to distribute their deficits between the<br>

two sides of the signifying effect of what we call here 'the letter' in the<br>
creation of signification. A point that will be clarified later.<br><br>
Thus the subject, too, if he can appear to be the slave of language<br>
is all the more so of a discourse in the universal movement in which<br>
his place is already inscribed at birth, if only byvirtue of his proper<br>
name.<br><br>
Reference to the experience of the community, or to the substance of<br>
this discourse, settles nothing. For this experience assumes its essential<br>
dimension in the tradition that this discourse itself establishes. This<br>

tradition, long before the drama of history is inscribed in it, lays down<br>
the elementary structures of culture. And these very structures reveal an<br>
ordering of possible exchanges which, even if unconscious, is inconceiv-<br>
able outside the permutations authorized by language.<br><br>
With the result that the ethnographic duality of nature and culture is<br>
giving way to a ternary conception of the human condition - nature,<br>
society, and culture - the last term of which could well be reduced to<br>
language, or that which essentially distinguishes human society from<br>
natural societies.<br><br>

But I shall not make of this distinction either a point or a point of de-<br>
parture, leaving to its own obscurity the question of the original rela-<br>
tions between the signifier and labour. I shall be content, for my little<br>
jab at the general function of <i>praxis</i> in the genesis of history, to point out<br>
that the very society that wished to restore, along with the privileges of<br>
the producer, the causal hierarchy of the relations between production<br>
and the ideological superstructure to their full political rights, has none<br>

the less failed to give birth to an ^esperanto in which the relations of lan-<br>
guage to socialist realities would have rendered any literary formalism<br>
radically impossible?<br><br>
For my part, I shall trust only those assumptions that have already<br>
proven their value by virtue of the fact that language through them has<br>
attained the status of an object of scientific investigation.<br><br>
For it is by virtue of this fact that linguistics is seen to occupy the key<br>
position in this domain, and the reclassification of the sciences and a re-<br>
grouping of them around it signals, as is usually the case, a revolution in<br>

knowledge; only the necessities of communication made me inscribe it<br>
at the head of this volume under the title 'the sciences of man' - despite<br>
the confusion that is thereby covered over.<br><br>
To pinpoint the emergence of linguistic science we may say that, as<br>
in the case of all sciences in the modern sense, it is contained in the<br>
constitutive moment of an algorithm that is its foundation. This algorithm<br>
is the following:<br>
<br>
</font><center><p>
<font color="#000000" face="Times Roman" size="+1"><u>S<br>

</u>s</font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Times Roman" size="+1"><br></font></p></center>
<font color="#000000" face="Times Roman" size="+1"><br>
which is read as: the signifier over the signified, 'over' corresponding to<br>
the bar separating the two stages.<br><br>
This sign should be attributed to Ferdinand de Saussure although it<br>
is not found in exactly this form in any of the numerous schemas, which<br>
none the less express it, to be found in the printed version of his lectures<br>
of the years I906-7, I908‹9, and I9I0-11,  which the piety of a group of<br>
his disciples caused to be published under the title, <i>Cours de linguistique<br>

génerale</i>, a work of prime importance for the transmission of a teaching<br>
worthy of the name, that is, that one can come to terms with only in its<br>
own terms.<br><br>
That is why it is legitimate for us to give him credit for the formula-<br>
tion S/s by which, in spite of the differences among schools, the begin-<br>
ning of modern linguistics can be recognized.<br><br>
The thematics of this science is henceforth suspended, in effect, at the<br>
primordial position of the signifier and the signified as being distinct<br>

orders separated initially by a barrier resisting signification. And that is<br>
what was to make possible an exact study of the connections proper to<br>
the signifier, and of the extent of their function in the genesis of the<br>
signified.<br><br>
For this primordial distinction goes well beyond the discussion con-<br>
cerning the arbitrariness of the sign, as it has been elaborated since the<br>
earliest reflections of the ancients, and even beyond the impasse which,<br>
through the same period, has been encountered in every discussion of the<br>
bi-univocal correspondence between the word and the thing, if only in<br>

the mere act of naming. All this, of course, is quite contrary to the<br>
appearances suggested by the importance often imputed to the role of the<br>
index finger pointing to an object in the learning pro¦ss of the<i> infans</i><br>
subject learning his mother tongue, or the use in foreign language<br>
teaching of so-called 'concrete' methods.<br><br>
One cannot go further along this line of thought than to demonstrate<br>
that no signification can be sustained other than by reference to another<br>
signification: in its extreme form this amounts to the proposition that<br>

there is no language (langue) in existence for which there is any question<br>
of its inability to cover the whole field of the signified, it being an effect<br>
of its existence as a language (langue) that it necessarily answers all needs.<br>
If we try to grasp in language the constitution of the object, we cannot<br>
fail to notice that this constitution is to be found only at the level of<br>
concept, a very different thing from a simple nominative, and that the<br>
thing, when reduced to the noun, breaks up into the double, divergent<br>
beam of the 'cause' (causa) in which it has taken shelter in the French<br>
word <i>chose,</i> and the nothing (rien) to which it has abandoned its Latin<br>

dress (rem).<br><br>


These considerations, important as their existence is for the philoso-<br>
pher, turn us away from the locus in which language questions us as to<br>
its very nature. And we will fail to pursue the question further as long<br>
as we cling to the illusion that the signifier answers to the function of<br>
representing the signified, or better, that the signifier has to answer for<br>
its existence in the name of any signification whatever.<br><br>
For even reduced to this latter formulation, the heresy is the same -<br>

the heresy that leads logical positivism in search of the 'meaning of<br>
meaning', as its objective is called in the language of its devotees. As a<br>
result, we can observe that even a text highly charged with meaning can<br>
be reduced, through this sort of analysis, to insignificant bagatelles, all<br>
that survives being mathematical algorithms that are, of course, without<br>
any meaning.<br><br>
To return to our formula S/s: if we could infer nothing from it but the<br>
notion of the parallelism of its upper and lower terms, each one taken in<br>
its globality, it would remain the enigmatic sign of a total mystery. Which<br>

of course is not the case.<br><br>
In order to grasp its function I shall begin by reproducing the classic,<br>
yet faulty illustration by which its usage is normally introduced, and one can see how it opens the way to the kind of error referred to above.<br><br>

<img src="agency1.jpeg" align="middle"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


In my lecture, I replaced this illustration with another, which has no<br>
greater claim to correctness than that it has been transplanted into that<br>

incongruous dimension that the psychoanalyst has not yet altogether<br>
renounced because of his quite justified feeling that his conformism<br>
takes its value entirely from it. Here is the other diagram:
<br>
<br>
<img src="agency2.jpeg" align="middle"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


where we see that, without greatly extending the scope of the signifier<br>
concerned in the experiment, that is, by doubling a noun through the<br>

mere juxtaposition of two terms whose complementary meanings ought<br>
apparently to reinforce each other, a surprise is produced by an unexpec-<br>
ted precipitation of an unexpected meaning: the image of twin doors<br>
symbolizing, through the solitary confinement offered Western Man for<br>
the satisfaction of his natural needs away from home, the imperative<br>
that he seems to share with the great majority of primitive communities<br>
by which his public life is subjected to the laws of urinary segregation.<br><br>
It is not only with the idea of silencing the nominalist debate with a<br>
low blow that I use this example, but rather to show how in fact the<br>

signifier enters the signified, namely, in a form which, not being im-<br>
material, raises the question of its place in reality. For the blinking gaze<br>
of a short sighted person might be justified in wondering whether this<br>
was indeed the signifier as he peered closely at the little enamel signs that<br>
bore it, a signifier whose signified would in this call receive its final<br>
honours from the double and solemn procession from the upper nave.<br><br>
But no contrived example can be as telling as the actual experience of<br>
truth. So I am happy to have invented the above, since it awoke in the<br>
person whose word I most trust a memory of childhood, which having<br>

thus happily come to my attention is best placed here.<br><br>
A train arrives at a station. A little boy and a little girl, brother and<br>
sister, are seated in a compartment face to face next to the window<br>
through which the buildings along the station platform can be seen<br>
passing as the train pulls to a stop. 'Look', says the brother, 'we're at<br>
Ladies!'; 'Idiot!' replies his sister, 'Can't you see we're at Gentlemen'.<br><br>
Besides the fact that the rails in this story materialize the bar in the<br>
Saussurian algorithm (and in a form designed to suggest that its resis-<br>
tance may be other than dialectical), we should add that only someone<br>

who didn't have his eyes in front of the holes (it's the appropriate image<br>
here) could possibly confuse the place of the signifier and the signified<br>
in this story, or not see from what radiating centre the signifier sends<br>
forth its light into the shadow of incomplete significations.<br><br>
For this signifier will now carry a purely animal Dissension, destined<br>
for the usual oblivion of natural mists, to the unbridled power of ideolo-<br>
gical warfare, relentless for families, a torment to the Gods. For these<br>
children, Ladies and Gentlemen will be hen¦forth two countries to-<br>
wards which each of their souls will strive on divergent wings, and<br>

between which a truce will be the more impossible since they are actually<br>
the same country and neither can compromise on its own superiority<br>
without detracting from the glory of the other.<br><br>
But enough. It is beginning to sound like the history of France. Which<br>
it is more human, as it ought to be, to evoke here than that of England,<br>
destined to tumble from the Large to the Small End of Dean Swift's egg.<br><br>
It remains to be conceived what steps, what corridor, the S of the<br>
signifier, visible here in the plurals in which it focuses its welcome<br>
beyond the window, must take in order to rest its elbows on the ventila-<br>

tors through which, like warm and cold air, indignation and scorn come<br>
hissing out below.<br><br>
One thing is certain: if the algorithm S/s with its bar is appropriate,<br>
access from one to the other cannot in any case have a signification. For<br>
in so far as it is itself only pure function of the signifier, the algorithm<br>
can reveal only the structure of a signifier in this transfer.<br><br>
Now the structure of the signifier is, as it is commonly said of language<br>
itself, that it should be articulated.<br><br>
This means that no matter where one starts to designate their recipro-<br>

cal encroachments and increasing inclusions, these units are subjected to<br>
the double condition of being reducible to ukimate differential elements<br>
and of combining them according to the laws of a closed order.<br><br>
These elements, one of the decisive discoveries of linguistics, are<br>
<i>phonemes;</i> but we must not expect to find any phonetic constancy in the<br>
modulatory variability to which this term applies, but rather the syn-<br>
chronic system of differential couplings necessary for the discernment of<br>
sounds in a given language. Through this, one sees that an essential<br>

element of the spoken word itself was predestined to flow into the<br>
mobile characters which, in a jumble of lower-case Didots or Gara-<br>
monds, render validly present what we call the 'letter', namely, the<br>
essentially localized structure of the signifier.<br><br>
With the second property of the signifier, that of combining according<br>
to the laws of a closed order, is affirmed the necessity of the topological<br>
substratum of which the term I ordinarily use, namely, the signifying<br>
chain, gives an approximate idea: rings of a neckla¦ that is a ring in<br>
another neckla¦ made of rings.<br><br>

Such are the structural conditions that define grammar as the order of<br>
constitutive encroachments of the signifier up to the level of the unit<br>
immediately superior to the sentence, and lexicology as the order of con-<br>
stitutive inclusions of the signifier to the level of the verbal locution.<br><br>
In examining the limits by which these two exerciseS in the under-<br>
standing of linguistic usage are determined, it is easy to see that only the<br>
correlations between signifier and signifier provide the standard for all<br>
research into signification, as is indicated by the notion of 'usage' of a<br>
taxeme or semanteme which in fact refers to the context just above that<br>

of the units con¦rned.<br><br>
But it is not because the undertakings of grammar and lexicology are<br>
exhausted within ¦rtain limits that we must think that beyond those<br>
limits signification reigns supreme. That would be an error.<br><br>
For the signifier, by its very nature, always anticipates meaning by<br>
unfolding its dimension before it. As is seen at the level of the sentence<br>
when it is interrupted before the significant term: 'I shall never...',<br>
'All the same it is...', 'And yet there may be. ..'. Such sentences are<br>
not without meaning, a meaning all the more oppressive in that it is<br>

content to make us wait for it.<br><br>
We are forced, then, to accept the notion of an incessant sliding of the<br>
signified under the signifier - which Ferdinand de Saussure illustrates<br>
with an image resembling the wavy lines of the upper and lower Waters<br>
in miniatures from manuscripts of Genesis; a double flux marked by fine<br>
streaks of rain, vertical dotted lines supposedly confining segments of<br>
correspondence.<br><br>
All our experience runs counter to this linearity, which made me speak<br>
once, in one of my seminars on psychosis, of something more like<br>

'anchoring points' ('points de capiton') as a schema for taking into account<br>
the dominance of the letter in the dramatic transformation that dialogue<br>
can effect in the subject.<br><br>
The linearity that Saussure holds to be constitutive of the chain of dis-<br>
course, in conformity with its emission by a single voice and with its<br>
horizontal posidon in our writing - if this linearity is necessary, in fact,<br>
it is not suflicient. It applies to the chain of discourse only in the direc-<br>
tion in which it is orientated in time, being taken as a signifying factor<br>
in all languages in which 'Peter hits Paul' reverses its dme when the terms<br>

are inverted.<br><br>
But one has only to listen to poetry, which Saussure was no doubt in<br>
the habit of doing, for a polyphony to be heard, for it to become clear<br>
that all discourse is aligned along the several staves of a score.<br><br>
There is in effect no signifying chain that does not have, as if attached<br>
to the punctuation of each of its units, a whole articulation of relevant<br>
contexts suspended 'vertically', as it were, from that point.<br><br>
Let us take our word 'tree' again, this time not as an isolated noun,<br>
but at the point of one of these punctuations, and see how it crosses the<br>

bar of the Saussurian algorithm. (The anagram of 'arbre' and 'barre'<br>
should be noted.)<br><br>
For even broken down into the double spectre of its vowels and con-<br>
sonants, it can still call up with the robur and the plane tree the significa-<br>
tions it takes on, in the context of our flora, of strength and majesty.<br>
Drawing on all the symbolic contexts suggested in the Hebrew of the<br>
Bible, it erects on a barren hill the shadow of the cross. Then reduces to<br>
the capital Y, the sign of dichotomy which, except for the illustration<br>
used by heraldry, would owe nothing to the tree however genealogical<br>

we may think it. Circulatory tree, tree of life of the cerebellum, tree of<br>
Saturn, tree of Diana, crystals formed in a tree struck by lightning, is it<br>
your figure that traces our desdny for us in the tortoise-shell cracked<br>
by the fire, or your lightning that causes that slow shift in the axis of<br>
being to surge up from an unnamable night into the '`
