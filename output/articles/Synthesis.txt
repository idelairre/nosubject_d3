In the [[mirror stage]] the [[infant]] sees its [[reflection]] in the [[mirror]] as  a [[whole]]/[[synthesis]], and this [[perception]] causes, by contrast, the [[perception]] of its own [[body]] (which [[lack]]s [[motor coordination]] at this [[stage]]) as [[division|divided]] and [[fragmentation|fragmented]]. 

However, the anticipation of a [[synthesis|synthetic]] [[ego]] is henceforth constantly threatened by the [[memory]] of this sense of [[fragmentation]], which manifests itself in "images of castration, emasculation, mutilation, dismemberment, dislocation, evisceration, devouring, bursting open of the body" which haunt the human imagination.<ref>{{E}} p.11</ref> 

Any such sense of disunity threatens the [[illusion]] of [[synthesis]] which constitutes the [[ego]].
