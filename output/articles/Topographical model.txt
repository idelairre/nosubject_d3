==Topology==

A [[topographical model]] uses imagined space to make a [[Freud]]'s theory of the [[mind]] or [[psyche]] understandable, helps us to picture the structure of the [[mind]] or [[psyche]].

==Topographical Model==
According to the [[Freud]]'s first "[[topographical model]]", the [[mind]] or [[psyche]]
is divided into three three separate component parts, systems or "psychical localities":

* the [[conscious]] ('''[[conscious|Cs]]'''),
* the [[preconscious]] ('''[[preconscious|Pcs]]''') and
* the [[unconscious]] ('''[[unconscious|Ucs]]''')

===Unconscious===
This simple model assumed that the [[unconscious]] was chiefly, if not entirely, derived from [[repression]], and therefore consisted of impulses, thoughts, and feelings, which were unacceptable to the [[conscious]] [[ego]]. 

===Material===
Material in the [[unconscious]] could never become [[conscious]], but material in the [[preconscious]] could occasionally become [[conscious]]. 

The [[unconscious]], Freud saw as containing material which had been [[repressed]] for some reason: because it was too [[traumatic]] or [[pain]]ful to reach [[consciousness]]. 

This material might consist of memories, fantasies, wishes, dreams, etc. 

===Development===
During the first 20 years of the twentieth century, [[Freud]] came to realize that this model  was inadequate. 


==Structural Model==
The three structures of the [[id]], [[ego]], and [[superego]] Freud saw as mapping onto this model. 

The [[ego]] he argued was not always [[conscious]], or even [[preconscious]]. 

The [[superego]], he argued, spanned the [[unconscious]] and the [[preconscious]], while the [[id]] was completely [[unconscious]].
