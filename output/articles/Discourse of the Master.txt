The [[discourse of the Master]] is the first of [[Lacan]]'s [[discourse|four discourses]] or four accounts of the social link provided in [[communication]].





[[Lacan]]'s "[[matheme]]" or [[symbol]] for the [[Master]] is [[Image:SS1.gif]].

In the [[discourse of the Master]], this [[symbol]] occupies the first (upper left) position in the formula.

[[Lacan]] calls this position the position of the "agent," that is, the one who is speaking.

The formula is written:
<center>[[Image:MASTERDISCOURSE.jpg]]</center>

The formula tells us that the [[Master]] ([[Image:SS1.gif]]) is [[speech|speaking]], that he is the agent.
