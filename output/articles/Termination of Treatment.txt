The end of psychoanalytic treatment

"''practical'' recovery of the patient, the restoration of his ability to lead an active life and of his capacity for enjoyment"



--


Freud specified the ideal conditions for termination of treatment.

<blockquote>"An analysis is ended when the analyst and the patient cease to meet each other for the analytic session. This happens when two conditions have been approximately fulfilled: first, that the patient shall no longer be suffering from his symptoms and shall have overcome his anxieties and his inhibitions; and secondly, that the analyst shall judge that so much repressed material has been made conscious, so much that was unintelligible has been explained, and so much internal resistance conquered, that there is no need to fear a repetition of the pathological processes concerned."<ref>1937c, p. 219</ref></blockquote>
