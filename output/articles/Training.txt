{{Top}}analyse didactique]]'', ''[[formation{{Bottom}}

=====Jacques Lacan=====
=====Translation=====
The English word "[[training]]" is used to translate two [[French]] terms used by [[Lacan]]: ''[[training|analyse didactique]]'' ("'''[[training analysis]]'''") and ''[[training|formation]]'' ("'''professional training'''").

=====Therapeutic Analysis=====
By the time [[Lacan]] began [[training]] as an [[analyst]], in the 1930s, it had become established [[practice]] in the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] ([[IPA]]) to make a distinction between "'''therapeutic analysis'''" and "'''training analysis'''" (this distinction is still maintained by the [[IPA]] today).

In the context of this distinction, the term "'''therapeutic analysis'''" refers to a course of [[analytic treatment]] entered into by the [[analysand]] for the purpose of treating certain [[symptom]]s, whereas the term "'''training analysis'''" refers exclusively to a course of [[analytic treatment]] entered into for the purpose of [[training]] as an [[analyst]].

=====Training Analysis=====
According to the rules governing all the societies affiliated to the [[IPA]], all members must first undergo a [[training|training analysis]] before being allowed to practice as [[analyst]]s.

However, an analysis is only recognized as a [[training analysis]] by these societies if it is conducted by one of the few senior analysts designated as a "[[training|training analyst]]", and if it is embarked upon purely for the purpose of [[training]].

This institutional distinction between [[training|training analysis]] and [[training|therapeutic analysis]] became one of the main objects of [[Lacan]]'s criticism.

=====Jacques Lacan=====
While [[Lacan]] agrees with the [[IPA]] that it is absolutely necessary to undergo [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]] if one wants to become an [[analyst]], he firmly disagrees with the artificial distinction drawn between [[training|therapeutic analysis]] and [[training|training analysis]].

For [[Lacan]], there is only one form of the [[treatment|analytic process]], irrespective of the reason for which the [[analysand]] embarks upon [[treatment]], and the culmination of that process is not the removal of [[symptom]]s but the passage from [[analysand]] to [[analyst]].

All analyses are thus capable of producing an [[analyst]], and all claims by institutions to say which analyses count as [[training]] and which do not are bogus, for "the authorisation of an analyst can only come from himself."<ref>{{L}} 1967. p. 14</ref>

[[Lacan]] therefore abolishes the distinction between [[training|therapeutic analysis]] and [[training|training analysis]]; all analyses are [[training|training analyses]], at least potentially.

<blockquote>"There is only one kind of psychoanalysis, the training analysis."<ref>{{S11}} p. 274</ref></blockquote>

Today, many [[Lacan]]ians have dispensed with both the term "[[training|therapeutic analysis]]" and the term "[[training|training analysis", preferring to use the term "[[training|personal analysis]] (a term [[Lacan]] himself uses occasionally) to designate any course of [[analytic treatment]].

=====Training of Analysts=====
The "[[training|training of analysts]]" ([[French]]: ''[[training|formation des analystes]]'') refers to the process by which people learn how to conduct [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]], i.e. how to be [[analyst]]s.

For [[Lacan]], this is not simply a process that [[analyst]]s go through at the beginning of their professional life, but an ongoing process.

There are two sources from which [[analyst]]s learn how to conduct [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]]: their own experience of [[treatment]] (first as [[patient]]s, then as [[analyst]]s), and the experience of others which is transmitted to them via [[psychoanalytic theory]].

[[Lacan]] insists that the most fundamental of these sources is the [[analyst]]'s own experience of [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]] as a [[patient]].

However, this does not excuse the [[analyst]] from having to learn a lot more besides.

[[Lacan]]'s syllabus for the [[training|training of analyst]]s is very extensive, and includes [[literature]], [[mathematics]] and [[history]].<ref>{{E}} p. 144-5</ref>

The [[analyst]] must seek to become, as [[Freud]] was, "an encyclopedia of the arts and muses."<ref>{{E}} p. 169</ref>

This broad curriculum is evident in [[Lacan]]'s public [[seminar]] which is filled with incursions into [[philosophy]], [[topology]], [[logic]], [[literature]] and [[linguistics]] - all of which [[Lacan]] regards as essential to the [[training]] of [[analyst]]s.

=====Translation=====
It is worth noting that the English term "[[training]]" is nuanced rather differently to the French term ''[[training|formation]]''.

Whereas the English term carries connotations of a formal programme, or a bureaucratic [[structure]], the [[French]] term (especially in [[Lacan]]'s work) connotes a process which alters the [[subject]] in the very kernel of his [[being]], and which cannot be regulated by set ritualistic procedures not guaranteed by a printed qualification.
