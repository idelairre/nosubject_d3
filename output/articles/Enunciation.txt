=====Translator's Note=====
The distinction between "''énoncé''" and "''énonciation''" is a common one in contemporary French thinking.

"''Énoncé''", which is translated as "[[statement]]", refers to the actual words uttered, "''énonciation''" to the act of uttering them.


=====Enunciation and Statement=====
In [[linguistics|linguistic theory]] in Europe, one important distinction is that between the [[enunciation]] and the [[statement]].

The [[statement]] refers to the actual words uttered; the [[enunciation]] refers to the act of uttering them.

=====Statement=====
A [[statement]] is [[speech]] analysed in terms of its abstract grammatical units, independent of the specific circumstances of occurrence.

=====Enunciation=====
An [[enunciation]] is [[speech]] analyzed as an individual act performed by a particular speaker at a specific time / place, and in a specific situation.

=====Jacques Lacan=====
=====Early Work=====
Long before [[Lacan]] uses these terms, he is aleady making a similar distinction.

In 1936, for example, he stresses that the act of [[speech|speaking]] contains a [[meaning]] in itself, even if the words spoken are "[[signification|meaningless]]."<ref>{{Ec}} p.83</ref>

Prior to any function it may have in "conveying a message," [[speech]] is an appeal to the [[other]].

This attention to the act of [[speech|speaking]] in itself, irrespective of the content of the utterance, anticipates [[Lacan]]'s attention to the dimension of the [[enunciation]].

=====Psychotic Language=====
When [[Lacan]] does come to use the term "[[enunciation]]" in 1946, it is first of all to describe strange characteristics of [[psychotic]] [[language]], with its "duplicity of the enunciation."<ref>{{Ec}} p.167</ref>

=====Subject of the Unconscious=====
Later, in the 1950s, the term is used to locate the [[subject]] of the [[unconscious]].

=====Graph of Desire=====
In the [[graph of desire]], the lower [[signifying chain|chain]] is the [[statement]], which is [[speech]] in its [[conscious]] dimension, while the upper [[signifying chain|chain]] is "the unconscious enunciation."<ref>{{E}} p.316</ref>

=====Unconscious Enunciation=====
In designating the [[enunciation]] as [[unconscious]], [[Lacan]] affirms that the source of [[speech]] is not the [[ego]], nor [[consciousness]], but the [[unconscious]]; [[language]] comes from the [[Other]], and the idea that "I" am [[master]] of my [[discourse]] is only an [[delusion|illusion]].

=====Subject of the Statement or Enunciation=====
The very word "I" (''Je'') is ambiguous; as [[shifter]], it is both a [[signifier]] acting as [[subject]] of the [[statement]], and an [[index]] which designate, but does not [[signification|signify]], the [[subject]] of the [[enunciation]].<ref>{{E}} p.298</ref>

=====Split Subject=====
The [[subject]] is thus [[split]] between these two levels, [[division|divided]] in the very act of articulating the ''I'' that presents the [[delusion|illusion]] of unity.<ref>{{S11}} p.139</ref>
