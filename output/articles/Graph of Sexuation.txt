According to [[Jacques Lacan]], <i>[[sexuation]]</i>, as distinct from [[biology|biological]] [[sexuality]], designates the way in which the [[subject]] is inscribed in the [[difference]] between the sexes, specifically in terms of the [[unconscious]] and [[castration]].

[[Lacan]] presented the complete [[table of the formulas of sexuation]] on March 13, 1973, during one of the lectures of his 1972-1973 [[seminar]] <i>[[Encore]]</i>.

[[Lacan]]'s choice of the term '[[sexuation]]', and not [[sexuality]], indicates that being recognized as a [[man]] or [[woman]] is a matter of the [[signifier]].

The [[phallus]] is situated as a [[symbol]], the [[signifier]] of [[castration]] and thus also of [[desire]]. 

The [[Law]] that is transmitted by the [[father]] and that states the [[prohibition]] against [[incest]] is also the [[foundation]] of [[desire]]. 
And this is the [[Law]] of [[castration]], which [[Lacan]] designated in his [[graph]] as the [[phallic function]], Φx.

To construct these [[formulas]], [[Lacan]] relied on the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] logic according to which propositions are categorized in four classes: 
# the universal affirmative, 
# the universal negative, 
#the particular affirmative, and 
# the particular negative. 

But Lacan adopted modern symbols for these categories, which are based on the universal quantifier, ∀, and the existential quantifier, ∃.

On the left side of the table, there appears the formula ∀xΦx, for all x Φ of x (all [[men]] are submitted to the [[phallic function]], that is, [[castratio]]). 

But modern logic has demonstrated the necessity of a particular negative, ∃xΦx (there [[exists]] at least one that is not submitted to the [[phallic function]]), in order to found the universal affirmative. 

This is the hypothesis that [[Sigmund Freud]] developed in his [[myth]] of the [[primal father]] in <i>[[Totem and Taboo]]</i><ref>1912-1913a</ref> and also in his argument that [[Moses]] was not a [[Jew]] in <i>[[Moses and Monotheism]]</i><ref>1939a</ref>: there always [[exists]] one who is an [[exception]]. 
This is how [[man]] is inscribed: by the [[phallic function]] but on the condition that this function "is limited due to the existence of an x by which the function Φx is negated."<ref>Lacan, p. 79</ref>
This is the function of the [[father]].


The other side of the table concerns the "woman portion of speaking beings."<ref>p. 80</ref> 
The upper line is read as follows: there does not exist any x that does not fall under the [[phallic function]]. 
In other words, [[castration]] functions for all [[women]]. 
But on the lower line [[Lacan]] introduced a [[negation]] marked by the barring of the universal quantifier, which is quite inconceivable from the perspective of formal logic. 
Lacan proposed that it be read as "[[not-whole]]."


The [[woman]]'s side of the table "will not allow for any universality."<ref>p. 80</ref>
[[Woman]] is not wholly within the [[phallic function]]. 
On this side there is no [[exception]] that could serve as the basis for a set of women. 
It is from this fact that Lacan derived the [[formula]], "[[Woman does not exist]]." 
This formula leaves no room for any idea of an "[[essence]]" of [[femininity]].

Below the table of formulas, there is a "scanded indication of what is in question" (p. 80). 
On the masculine side, there is the barred subject "and the F that props him up as signifier" (p. 80). 
For the [[male]] is only able to reach his partner, the [[Other]], through [[castration]] and the mediation of the ''[[object a]]'' as its effect. 
This is indicated by the arrow that crosses from the male side to the female side, which also reproduces the Lacanian formula of [[fantasy]]. 
On the feminine side, [[woman]] is doubled: she has a relation with F, insofar as a [[man]] incarnates it for her. 
But she is not wholly in that relation. 
She also has a relation to the [[signifier]] of A, the [[signifier]] that the [[Other]] would need if a set of women were going to be formed. 
Woman's [[jouissance]] is thus divided between [[phallic jouissance]], linked to [[castration]] and appearing on the [[Graph]] as F, and an [[Other jouissance]] that is unique to her. 
Thus there is neither symmetry between the two sides of the table, nor any complementarity between the sexes.
