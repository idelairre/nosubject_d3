=====The Case of Aimée=====
The [[thesis]] contains a detailed analysis of a [[woman]], named [[Aimée]] after the heroine of one of her unpublished novels, who had attempted to stab a well-known [[Paris]]ian acctress, [[Huguette Duflos]].  The case was widely reported in the press at the time, and [[Lacan]] tried gradually to piece together the logic behind her apparently irrational [[act]].  His [[thesis]] introduced a new concept into the [[psychiatry|psychiatric milieu]], that of "[[self-punishment paranoia]]".  [[Lacan]] argued that, in striking the actress, [[Aimée]] was in fact striking herself: [[Duflos]] represented a [[woman]] with [[freedom]] and [[culture|social prestige]], exactly the sort of [[woman]] that [[Aimée]] aspired to become.

In her ideas of persecution, it was this figure that she saw as the source of [[threats]] to her and her young son.  The [[ideal image]] was thus both the [[object]] of her [[hate]] and of her aspiration.  [[Lacan]] was especially interested here in this complex relation to [[image]]s and the ideas of [[identity]] to be found in [[paranoia]].  In her subsequent arrest and confinement, she found the [[punishment]] which was a real source of the [[act]] itself.  She understood, at a certain level, that ''she was herself the [[object]] of [[punishment]]''.

[[Lacan]]'s analysis of the [[case]] shows many of the features which would later become central to his work: [[narcissism]], the [[image]], the [[ideal]], and how the [[personality]] could extend beyond the limits of the [[body]] and be constituted within a [[symbolic|complex social network]].  The actress represented a part of [[Aimée]] herself, indicating how the [[identity]] of a [[human]] [[being]] could include elements well [[outside]] the [[biological]] boundaries of the [[body]].  In a sense, ''[[Aimée]]'s [[identity]] was literally [[outside]] of herself''.
