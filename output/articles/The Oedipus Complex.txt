Lacan developed his views on the [[Oedipus complex]], which have a very different emphasis from those of [[Freud]], in a series of [[seminar]]s and [[Jacques Lacan:Bibliography|essays]] from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s.




In [[Sigmund Freud:Bibliography|Freud's writings]] the [[Oedipus complex]] refers to an organized set of loving and hostile wishes which the young child experiences towards its parents.

The [[child]] desires the death of its rival, the parent of the same sex, whilst harboring sexual desires for the parent of the opposite sex.

According to [[Freud]], the peak period for the experience of the [[Oedipus complex]] is at about three to five years of age.

He considered that the [[Oedipus complex]] played a fundamental part in structuring the personality, and in the orientation of [[human]] [[desire]]s; and that it was basic to [[psychoanalytic theory]] and [[practice]].

[[Lacan]]'s particular contribution to this area of [[psychoanalysis]] is the emphasis he gives to the function of the ''[[lack|lack of the object]]'', and ''[[lack]]'' in general.
