=====Theory of the Mirror Phase=====
''[[Humans]] are [[born]] [[helplessness|prematurely]].'' Left to themselves, they would probably [[die]].  They are always [[born]] too [[time|early]].  They can't walk or [[speech|talk]] at [[birth]]: they have a very partial [[mastery]] of their motor functions and, at the [[biology|biological level]], they are hardly [[complete]].  The [[infant]] can't pick things up or move towards or away from things.  So how does the child come to [[master]] its relation to its [[body]]?  How does it respond to its "[[prematuration]]"?
