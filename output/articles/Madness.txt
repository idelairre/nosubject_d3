==Madness==
When [[Lacan]] uses the term "[[madness]]," or refers to someone as being "[[mad]]," he is referring to [[psychosis]]:

<blockquote>"The psychoses ... correspond to what has always been callled and legitimately continues to be called ''madness''."<ref>{{S3}} p. 4</ref></blockquote>

==Usage==
[[Lacan]] adds that "there is no reason to deny oneself the luxury of the word."<ref>{{S3}} p.4</ref>

Thus far from seeing it as a derogatory term, [[Lacan]] values it for its poetic resonances, and approves of its use, on condition that it is used in the precise sense of [[psychosis]].

So, for example, in 1946 [[Lacan]] congratulates the French psychiatrist Henry Ey for "obstinately preserving the term."<ref>{{Ec}} p. 154</ref>
