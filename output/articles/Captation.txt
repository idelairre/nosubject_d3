{{Top}}capter|captation{{Bottom}}

==Origin of the Term==
The [[French]] substantive ''[[captation]]'' is a neologism coined by [[French]] [[psychoanalysts]] from the verb ''[[captation|capter]]''.<ref>Ã‰douard Pichon and Odile Codet</ref>

==Jacques Lacan==
It was adopted by [[Jacques Lacan]] in [[1948]] and occurs regularly in his [[work]] from this point on.

==Imaginary Effects of the Specular Image==
[[Lacan]] uses the term ''[[captation]]'' to describe the [[imaginary]] effects of the [[specular image]] on the [[subject]].<ref>{{E}} p. 18</ref>

The double sense of the [[French]] term nicely  indicates the ambiguous nature of the [[power]] of the [[specular image]]:

* On the one hand, it conveys the sense of "[[captivation]]," thus expressing the fascinating, [[seduction|seductive power]] of the [[image]].

* On the other hand, the term also conveys the idea of "[[capture]]," which evokes the more sinister power of the [[image]] to imprison the [[subject]] in a disabling fixation.
