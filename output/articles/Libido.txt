In [[psychoanalysis]], the term "[[libido]]" is used to describe a mental -- psychic and emotional -- energy associated with [[instinct]]ual [[biology|biological]] [[drive]]s.

==Sigmund Freud==

The term "[[libido]]" was introduced into [[psychoanalytic theory]] by [[Freud]].

[[Freud]] often employs metaphors from the [[science]] of hydraulics to describe [[libido]].

[[Freud]] conceives of the [[libido]] as an "economic" concept.

It is said to be quantifiable, plastic and adhesive, and can be attached to or withdrawn from [[object]]s thanks to the mechanism of [[cathexis]].

It is an energy which can increase or descrease, and which can be displaced.<ref>[[Freud|Freud, Sigmund]]. [[SE]] XVIII. 1921c. p.90.</ref>

It can be desexualized or used in [[sublimation]].

===Sexual Desire===

[[Freud]] insisted on the sexual nature of this energy.

[[Libido]] is a specifically sexual energy.

[[Libido]] is also described by [[Freud]] as being [[active]] and [[masculine]].

Throughout his work, [[Freud]] maintained a dualism in which the [[libido]] is opposed to another (non-sexual) form of energy.

[[Freud]] made a distinction between the sexual or libidinal drives and the self-preservation of ego drives.

===Carl Jung===
One of the major sources of the disagreement between [[Freud]] and [[Jung]] is the later's tendency to desexualize the concept of [[libido]] and to dissolve it into a more general category of mental energy.

[[Jung]] opposed this dualism, positing a single form of life-energy which is neutral in character, and proposed that this energy be denoted by the term "[[libido]]."

==Jacques Lacan==

[[Lacan]] uses the term "[[libido]]" very sparingly, and tends to discuss sexuality in terms of [[desire]] and ''[[jouissance]]''.

In general [[Lacan]] does not use the term "[[libido]]" anywhere near as frequently as [[Freud]], preferring to reconceptualize sexual energy in terms of ''[[jouissance]]''.

[[Lacan]] rejects [[Jung]]'s monism and reaffirms [[Freud]]'s dualism.<ref>{{S1}} p.119-20</ref>

He argues, with [[Freud]], that the [[libido]] is exclusively [[sexual]].

[[Lacan]] also follows [[Freud]] in affirming that the [[libido]] is exclusively [[masculine]].<ref>{{E}} p.291</ref>

===Imaginary and the Real===

In the 1950s [[Lacan]] locates the [[libido]] in the [[imaginary order]].

<blockquote>"Libido and the ego are on the same side.  Narcissism is libidinal."<ref>{{S2}} p.326</ref></blockquote>

From 1964 on, however, there is a shift to articulating the [[libido]] more with the [[real]].<ref>{{Ec}} p.848-9</ref>
