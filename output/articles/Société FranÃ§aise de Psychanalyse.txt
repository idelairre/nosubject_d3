[[Lacan]] was a member of the [[Société Parisienne de Psychanalyse]] ([[SPP]]) which was a member body of the [[International Psycho-Analytical Association]] ([[IPA]]). In 1953, after a disagreement about analytic practice methods, [[Lacan]] (and many of his colleagues) left the [[SPP]] to form (a new group) the [[Société Française de Psychanalyse]] ('''SFP''').

The [[SFP]] asked to be affiliated to the [[International Psycho-Analytical Association]] ([[IPA]]).

The [[Société Française de Psychanalyse]] ([[SFP]]) ([[French Psychoanalytic Society]]) was a French psychoanalytic society founded on June 18, 1953.


[[Jacques Lacan]] was a founding member of the [[SFP]].

In the following years a complex process of negotiation took place to determine the status of the '''SFP''' within the [[IPA]]. [[Lacan]]'s practice with his controversial innovaiton of variable-length sessions and the critical stance he took towards much of the accepted orthodoxy of psychoanalytic theory and practice led (in 1963) to a condition being set by the [[IPA]] that the registration of the '''SFP''' was dependent upon [[Lacan]] being removed from the list of training analysts within the organization. The [[IPA]] demanded [[Lacan]]'s expulsion.  [[Lacan]] was expelled, finally excommunicated by the [[IPA|International]], and his teaching was condemned. In 1963 the [[IPA]] permitted him to practise [[anlaysis]] but not to teach or [[training|train]] candidates. The [[SFP]] divided into those willing to recognize the condition laid down by the [[IPA]] -- the exclusion of [[Lacan]] from the training program, and those who regrouped around [[Lacan]]. [[Lacan]] refused such a condition and left the '''SFP''' to form his won school (which became known as the) [[École Freudienne de Paris]] ([[EFP]]). In 1964 Lacan went on to found his own [[school]], [[École Freudienne de Paris]] ([[EFP]]).

The members of the S.F.P. disbanded in 1963 and announced the group's dissolution in 1964.
