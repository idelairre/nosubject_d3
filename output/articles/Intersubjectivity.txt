=====Jacques Lacan=====
=====Early Work=====
=====Speech=====
When [[Lacan]] begins -- in 1953 -- to analyze in detail the function of [[speech]] in [[psychoanalysis]], he emphasizes  that [[speech]] is essentially an [[intersubjective]] process.

<blockquote>"The allocution of the [[subject]] entails an allocutor" and therefore "the locutor is constituted in it as [[intersubjectivity]]."<ref>{{E}} p. 49</ref></blockquote>

=====Language=====
The term "[[intersubjectivity]]" thus possesses, at this point in [[Lacan]]'s work, a positive value, since it draws attention to the importance of [[language]] in [[psychoanalysis]] and emphasizes the fact that the [[unconscious]] is "[[intersubjectivity|transindividual]]."

=====Psychoanalysis=====
[[Psychoanalysis]] is thus to be conceived in [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] rather than intrasubjective terms.

===Later Work===
=====Reciprocity and Symmetry=====
However, by 1960 the term "[[intersubjectivity]]" has come to acquire negative connotations for [[Lacan]].

It is now associated, not with [[speech]] as such, but with the notions of reciprocity and symmetry that characterize the [[dual relationship]];<ref>{{S8}} p. 20</ref> that is, with the [[imaginary]] rather than with the [[symbolic]].

=====Psychoanalysis=====
[[Psychoanalysis]] is no longer to be conceived of in terms of [[intersubjectivity]].<ref>{{S8}} p. 20</ref>

=====Transference=====
Indeed, the experience of [[transference]] is precisely what undermines the notion of [[intersubjectivity]].<ref>{{L}} (1967) "[[Works of Jacques Lacan|Proposition du 9 octubre 1967 sur le psychanalyste de l'École]]," ''Scilicet'', no. 1 (1968) pp. 14-30</ref>
