<blockquote>It is comprehensible that children should tell lies when in doing so they mimic the lies of grownup people. But a number of the lies of well-brought-up children have a peculiar significance, and should cause their instructors to reflect rather than to be angry. These lies proceed from the influence of an excessive love motive.<ref>{{IML}}</ref></blockquote>
