Žižek, S. and von Schelling, F.W.J. (1975) The Abyss of Freedom      - Ages
of the World, Michigan: University of Michigan Press.
Reprising much of the material from the first part of The Indivisible
Remainder, this book combines Žižek's essay on Schelling's Ages of the
World with the first ever English translation of the second draft of that
title. Žižek argues that at the centre of the Ages of the World is the
struggle to resolve the enigma of sufEcient reason. While most philoso-
phers attempt to explain freedom, Schelling reverses the terms of the
question and asks how we emerged from a state of freedom and became
caught in a network of reason. Žižek's analysis of the answer to this
question is often difEcult (as is Schelling's deceptively simple prose),
but is, nevertheless, recognizably cognate with the discussions of Hegel
and Lacan that he undertakes in other monographs.
