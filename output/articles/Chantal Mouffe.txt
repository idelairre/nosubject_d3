'''Chantal Mouffe''' (born 1943 in Charleroi, Belgium) is a Belgian [[political theorist]]. She is a Professor in the University of Westminster and she co-authored ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]'' with [[Ernesto Laclau]]. Their thoughts are usually described as post-Marxist as they were both politically active in the social and student movements of the 1960s and were thus active working class and new social movements (notably second-wave [[feminism]] in Mouffe's case). They rejected [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[economic determinism]] and the notion of [[class struggle]] being the single crucial [[antagonism]] in [[society]]. Instead they urged for radical [[democracy]] of [[agonistic pluralism]] where all antagonisms could be expressed. In their opinion, "...there is no possibility of society without antagonism," which is why they claimed that "society does not exist."
