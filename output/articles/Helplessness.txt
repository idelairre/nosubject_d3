==Dependency==
The term "[[helplessness]]" is used in [[psychoanalysis]] to denote the state of the newborn [[development|infant]] who is incapable of carrying out the specific [[act]]ions required to [[desire|satisfy]] its own [[need]]s, and so is completely ''dependent'' on other people (especially the [[mother]]).

==Prematurity==
The [[helplessness]] of the [[development|human infant]] is grounded in its "'''prematurity'''" of birth, a fact which was pointed out by [[Freud]] and which [[Lacan]] takes up in his [[Jacques Lacan:Bibliography|early writings]].  Compared to other [[nature|animal]]s such as apes, the [[development|human infant]] is relatively unformed when it is born, especially with respect to ''motor coordination''.  This means that it is more ''dependent'' than other [[nature|animal]]s, and for a longer time, on its parents.

==Mother-Child Dual Relation==
[[Lacan]] follows [[Freud]] in highlighting the importance of the initial ''dependence'' of the [[development|human infant]] on the '''[[mother]]'''.  [[Lacan]]'s originality lies in the way he draws attention to "the fact that this dependence is maintained by a world of [[language]].<ref>{{E}} p. 309</ref>  The [[mother]] [[interpretation|interpret]]s the [[infant]]'s cries as hunger, tiredness, loneliness, etc. and [[punctuation|retroactively]] determines their [[signification|meaning]] (see [[punctuation]]).  The [[development|child]]'s [[helplessness]] contrasts with the omnipotence of the [[mother]], who can decide whether or not to [[desire|satisfy]] the [[development|child]]'s [[need]]s.<ref>{{S4}} p. 69, 185</ref> The recognition of this contrast engenders a depressive effect in the [[child]].<ref>{{S4}} p. 186</ref>

==End of Analysis==
[[Lacan]] also uses the concept of [[helplessness]] to illustrate the sense of '''abandonment''' and '''[[subjective destitution]]''' that the [[analysand]] feels at the [[end of analysis]]. "At the end of a [[training]] [[analysis]] the [[subject]] should reach and know the domain and level of the experience of absolute disarray."<ref>{{S7}} p. 304</ref> The [[end of analysis]] is not conceived of by [[Lacan]] as the realization of some blissful plenitude, but quite the contrary, as a moment when the [[subject]] comes to terms with his utter solitude. However, whereas the [[development|infant]] can rely on its [[mother]]'s [[helplessness|help]], the [[analysand]] at the [[end of analysis]] "can expect [[help]] from no one."<ref>{{S7}} p. 304</ref> If this seems to present a particularly ascetic view of [[treatment|psychoanalytic treatment]], this is exactly how [[Lacan]] wishes it to be seen; [[psychoanalysis]] is, in [[Lacan]]'s words, a "long subjective ascesis."<ref>{{E}} p. 105</ref>
