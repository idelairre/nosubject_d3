==Structure==
A [[quaternary]] is a [[structure]] which comprises four elements. 

Although [[Lacan]]'s rejection of dualistic schemas in favour of an emphasis on the triangular structure of the [[symbolic]] involves a predominance of triadic schemes in his work, Lacan also insists on the importance of fourfold schemes: 

<blockquote>A quadripartite structure has, since the introduction of the unconscious, always been required in the con- struction of a subjective ordering.<ref>{{Ec}} p. 774</ref></blockquote>

==Anthropology==
The emphasis on the [[quaternary]] first comes to the fore in Lacan's work in the early 1950s, and is perhaps due to the influence of Claude LÃˆvi-Strauss, whose work on the structure of the avunculate shows that the basic unit of kinship always involves a minimum of four terms.<ref>Levi-Strauss, 1945</ref>

Thus, in a 1953 paper which deals with the neurotic's 'individual myth' (another reference to Levi-Strauss), Lacan remarks that "there is within the neurotic a quartet situation,"<ref>{{L}} 1953b: 231</ref> and adds that this quartet can demonstrate the particularities of each case of neurosis more rigorously than the traditional triangular thematisation of the Oedipus complex.<ref>{{L}} 1953b:232</ref>

He concludes that "the whole oedipal schema needs to be re-examined."<ref>{{L}} 1953b: 235</ref>

Thus, in addition to the three elements of the Oedipus complex (mother, child, father), Lacan often speaks of a fourth element; sometimes he argues that this fourth element is [[death]],<ref>{{L}} 1953b: 237; S4, 431</ref> and at other times he argues that it is the [[phallus]].<ref>{{S3}} p.319</ref>

In 1955, [[Lacan]] goes on to compare [[psychoanalytic treatment]] to bridge, "a game for four players."<ref>{{E}} p.139, 229-230</ref>

In the same year, he describes a [[quaternary]] made up of a [[triad]]ic [[structure]] plus a fourth element (the [[letter]]) which circulates among these three elements.<ref>{{L}} 1955a</ref>

---

Other important [[quaternary]] [[structure]]s which appear in [[Lacan]]'s work are [[schema L]] (which has four nodes), the four partial drives and their four corresponding [[part-object]]s, and the [[four discourses]] (each of which has four symbols assigned to four places). 

[[Lacan]] also enumerates four "fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis"<ref>{{L}} 1964a</ref> and speaks of the [[sinthome]] as a fourth ring which prevents the other three rings in the [[borromean knot]] (the three orders of the [[real]], the [[symbolic]] and the [[imaginary]]) from becoming separated.
