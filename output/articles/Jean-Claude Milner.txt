====Work====
With its first publications Milner of one was the earliest französischern Sprachwisenschaftler, which rezipierte the linguistics of Noam Chomsky in France, whose Aspects OF A Theory OF syntax Milner translated. However it protested against the cognition-biological bases, which Chomsky wanted to give in later publications to its language theory. Although it holds to the formal framework, which Chomskys Generative grammar in their different development stages made available, he developed in such a way to a critic of the Chomsky linguistics, whose problem he represented une science you langage (Seuil, 1989) in its book Introduction à. This work is a wissenschaftstheortetische investigation to the Epistemologie of the linguistics, to which there is little comparable in its kind.

While Chomskys linguistics made the formal description methods available for Milners linguistics and the substantial science-theoretical beginnings come from Alexandre Koyré, is the central, although theoretical point of reference always explicitly not specified the work of the Psychoanlytikers Lacan, which he in L' œuvre claire. Lacan, la science et la philosophy (Seuil, 1995) as a clear rational philosopher - and not as dadaistischen “Poststruktualisten” - porträtierte.

Besides Milner published work to the literature (Détections of fictives, Seuil, 1985, Dire le verse, together with François Regnault, Seuil, 1987; Mallarmé outer tombeau, Verdier, 1999) and intervened in the public discussion around the European Antisemitismus (Les penchants criminels de l'Europe démocratique, Verdier, 2003) and around the situation of the culture in France, that in its opinion most most culture and intelligence-most hostile country in the world (Existe t IL une vie intellectuelle EN France? , Verdier, 2002). In its book Archéologie D' un échec, 1950-1993 (Seuil, 1993) he described history that linking in France - to which he to add actual and the failure of its illusions.
