{{I}}


The [[imaginary]] is one of the [[order|three orders]] that [[structure]] [[human]] [[existence]], the others being the [[symbolic]] and the [[real]].



[[Lacan]]'s concept of the [[Imaginary]] first appeared in his [[{{Y}}|1936]] [[Jacques Lacan:Bibliography|paper]] "[[The Mirror Stage]]".



The [[imaginary]] arises from the [[infant]]'s experience of its [[specular ego]].


In the [[mirror stage]], the [[child]] [[identification|identifies]] with the [[specular image]], and this inaugurates the series of [[identification]]s that will consturct the [[ego]].

The [[child]] is literally [[captivate]]d by a [[specular]] [[other]] thanks to an [[identification]] which is also an [[alienation]].

The [[imaginary]] is thus the realm in which self and other merge, and in which identity is grounded in a mere semblance of unity.



The [[imaginary]] is not a stage which is overcome or transcended, and is a cosntant presence in the lives of human subjects.

It arises with the [[mirror stage]] but extends far into the adult individual's experience of others and of the external world.
