== About the Authors ==
Carl Steadman's alter ego is Kid A In Alphabet Land. Mild-mannered Carl conceived, wrote, and
designed ''Kid A In Alphabet Land'', and he did it all for you.
Andra Brubaker is not only a ruinous femme fatale, she's also illustrator for ''Kid A In Alphabet Land''.  She's collaborated with Carl on other projects, including the ''Procter &amp; Gamble Coloring Book'' and ''[http://www.ratstocats.com Rats To Cats]''!
Michael Herman, not related to Pee-wee, but guilty of the same crimes, contributed the text to S. Had things gone differently, S might have been the secret, but then the secret is, after all, that there is no secret.

Special thanks to Jochen Schulte-Sasse, who didn't encourage us, but didn't discourage us (this would change later, of course), and to Slavoj Zizek, who, at first, "didn't know about these," which was a true statement, but flattering nonetheless.
