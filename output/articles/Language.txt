{{Top}}langue]]'', ''[[langage{{Bottom}}

=====Translation=====
It is important to note that the English word "[[language]]" corresponds to two French words: ''[[langue]]'' and ''[[langage]]''.

These two words have quite different meanings in [[Lacan]]'s work: ''[[langue]]'' usually refers to a specific [[language]], such as French or English, whereas ''[[langage]]'' refers to the system of [[language]] in general, abstracting from all particular languages.

=====Jacques Lacan=====
It is fundamentally the general structure of [[language]] (''[[langage]]''), rather than the differences between particular languages ('''[[langue]]s'') that interests [[Lacan]].

When reading [[Lacan]] in English it is therefore essential to be aware of which term is used in the original French; most of the time the French term will be ''[[langage]]''.

=====Psychoanalytic Experience=====
Between 1936 and 1949 references to [[language]] are sparse, but they are significant; already in 1936, for example, [[Lacan]] emphasizes that [[language]] is constitutive of the psychoanalytic experience,<ref>{{Ec}} p.82</ref> and in 1946 he argues that it is impossible to understand [[madness]] without addressing the problem of [[language]].<ref>{{Ec}} p. 166</ref>

[[Lacan]]'s comments on [[language]] at this time do not contain any references to a specific [[linguistics|linguistic theory]], and instead are dominated by [[philosophy|philosophical allusions]], mainly in terms derived from [[Hegel]].

Thus [[language]] is seen primarily as a mediating element which permits the [[subject]] to attain recognition from the other.<ref>{{E}} p. 9</ref>

Above and beyond its use for conveying information, [[language]] is first and foremost an appeal to an interlocutor; in [[Jakobson]]'s terms, [[Lacan]] stresses the connative function above the referential.

Thus he insists that [[langage]] is not a nomenclature.<ref>{{Ec}} p. 166</ref>

=====Anthropology and Phenomenology=====
From 1950 to 1954 [[language]] begins to occupy the central position that it will hold in [[Lacan]]'s work thereafter.

In this period, [[Lacan]]'s discussion of [[language]] is dominated by references to [[Heideggerian]] [[phenomenology]] and, more importantly, to the [[anthropology]] of [[language]] ([[Anthropology|Maus, Malinowski, and Lévi-Strauss]].

[[Language]] is thus seen as [[structure|structuring]] the [[law|social laws of exchange]], as a symbolic pact, etc.

There are also occasional references to rhetoric, but these are not elaborated.<ref>{{E}} p. 169</ref>

There are a few allusions to [[Saussure]],<ref>{{S1}} p. 248</ref> but in his famous "[[Rome Discourse]]" [[Lacan]] establishes an opposition between ''[[parole]]'' and ''[[language|langage]]'' (and not, as [[Saussure]] does, between ''[[parole]]'' and ''[[language|langue]]''.<ref>{{L}}. "''Fonction et champ de la parole et du langage en psychanalyse.''" 1953a. In {{E}} p. 237-322. ("The function and field of speech and language in psychoanalysis.")  In {{E}}. p. 30-113</ref>

====="The Unconscious is Structured like a Language"=====
Between 1955 and 1970 [[language]] takes center stage and [[Lacan]] develops his classic thesis that "the unconscious is structured like a language."<ref>{{S11}} p. 20</ref>

It is in this period that the names [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Roman Jakobson]] come to the fore in [[Lacan]]'s [[Works of Jacques Lacan|work]].

=====Structural Linguistics=====
[[Lacan]] takes up [[Saussure]]'s theory that [[language]] is a [[structure]] composed of differential elements, but whereas [[Saussure]] had stated this of ''[[language|langue]]'', [[Lacan]] states it of ''[[language|langage]]''.

''[[language|Langage]]'' becomes, for [[Lacan]], the single paradigm of all [[structures]].

[[Lacan]] then proceeds to criticize the [[Saussure]]an concept of [[language]], arguing that the basic unit of [[language]] is not the [[sign]] but the [[signifier]].

[[Lacan]] then argues that the [[unconscious]] is, like [[language]], a [[structure]] of [[signifiers]], which also allows [[Lacan]] to formulate the category of the [[symbolic]] with greater precision.

In 1969 [[Lacan]] develops a concept of [[discourse]] as a kind of [[discourse|social bond]].

=====Psychotic Language=====
From 1971 on, the shift from [[linguistics]] to [[mathematics]] as the paradigm of [[science|scientificity]] is accompanied by a tendency to emphasize the poetry and ambiguity of [[language]], as is evident in [[Lacan]]'s increasing interest in the "[[psychotic]] [[language]]" of [[James Joyce]].<ref>{{L}}. "Joyce le symptôme." 1975a. In Jacques Aubert (ed.), ''Joyce avec Lacan''. Paris: Navarin, 1987.</ref>

[[Lacan]]'s own style reflects this change as it becomes ever more densely populated with puns and neologisms.

=====''Lalangue''=====
[[Lacan]] coins the term ''[[language|lalangue]]'' (from the definite article ''la'' and the noun ''[[language|langue]]'') to refer to these non-communicative aspects of [[language]] which, by playing on ambiguity and homophony, give rise to a kind of ''[[jouissance]]''.<ref>{{S20}} p. 126</ref>

The term "[[language]]" now becomes opposed to ''[[language|lalangue]]''.

''[[language|Lalangue]]'' is like the primary chaotic substrate of polysemy out of which [[language]] is constructed, almost as if [[language]] is some ordered superstructure sitting on top of this substrate:

<blockquote>"Language is without doubt made of ''lalangue''.  It is an elucubration of [[knowledge]] (''[[knowledge|savoir]]'') about ''lalangue''.<ref>{{S20}} p. 127</ref></blockquote>

=====Lacanian Psychoanalysis=====
=====Language in Analytic Treatment=====
It is the emphasis placed by [[Lacan]]ian [[psychoanalysis]] that is usually regarded as its most distinctive feature.

[[Lacan]] criticizes the way that other forms of [[psychoanalysis]], such as [[Kleinian psychoanalysis]] and [[object-relations theory]], tend to play down the importance of [[language]] and emphasize the "non-verbal communication" of the [[analysand]] (his "body language," etc.) at the expense of the [[analysand]]'s [[speech]]).

This is a fundamental error, according to [[Lacan]], for three main reasons.

:1. Firstly, all [[human]] [[communication]] is inscribed in a [[linguistic]] [[structure]]; even "body language," is, as the term implies, fundamentally a form of ''[[language]]'', with the same [[structure|structural features]].

:2. Secondly, the whole aim of [[psychoanalytic treatment]] is to articulate the [[truth]] of one's [[desire]] in [[speech]] rather than in any other medium; the fundamental rule of [[psychoanalysis]] is based on the principle that [[speech]] is the only way to this [[truth]].

:3. And thirdly, [[speech]] is the only tool which the [[analyst]] has; therefore, any [[analyst]] who does not understand the way [[speech]] and [[language]] work does not understand [[psychoanalysis]] itself.<ref>{{E}} p. 40</ref>

One consequence of [[Lacan]]'s emphasis on [[language]] is his recommendation that the [[analyst]] must attend to the formal features of the [[analysand]]'s [[speech]] (the [[signifiers]]), and not be sidetracked into an empathic attitude baseed on an [[imaginary]] understanding of the content (the [[signified]]).

=====Symbolic and Imaginary Dimensions=====
One common misconception of [[Lacan]] is that [[language]] is synonymous with the [[symbolic]] [[order]].

This is, however, not correct; [[Lacan]] argues that [[language]] has both a [[symbolic]] and an [[imaginary]] dimension.

<blockquote>"There is something in the symbolic function of human discourse that cannot be eliminated, and that is the role played in it by the imaginary."<ref>{{S2}} p.306</ref></blockquote>

The [[symbolic|symbolic dimension]] of [[language]] is that of the [[signifier]] and [[speech|true speech]].

The [[imaginary]] dimension of [[language]] is that of the [[signified]], [[signification]], and [[speech|empty speech]].

[[Schema L]] represents these two dimensions of [[language]] by means of two axes which intersect.

The axis '''A-S''' is [[language]] in its [[symbolic|symbolic dimension]]], the [[discourse]] of the [[Other]], the [[unconscious]].

The [[imaginary]] axis ''a'''-''a'' is [[language]] in its [[imaginary|imaginary dimension]], the wall of [[language]] which interrupts, distorts and [[inversion|invert]]s the [[discourse]] of the [[Other]].

In [[Lacan]]'s words, "language is as much there to be found in the Other as to drastically prevent us from understanding him.<ref>{{S2}} p. 244</ref>

=====Languages and Codes=====
[[Lacan]] distinguishes between [[language]]s and [[code]]s; unlike [[code]]s, in [[language]] there is no stable one-to-one correspondence between [[sign]] and [[sign|referent]], nor between [[signified]] and [[signifier]].

It is this property of [[language]] which gives rise to the inherent ambiguity of all [[discourse]], which can only be interpreted by playing on the homophony and other forms of equivocation (''l'équivoque'').
