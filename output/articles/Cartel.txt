==History==
The [[cartel]] is the basic working unit on which [[Lacan]] based his [[school]] of [[psychoanalysis]], the ''[[École Freudienne de Psychanalyse]]'' ([[EFP]]), and most [[Lacan]]ian [[associations]] continue to organize work in [[cartels]] today.

In his [[Founding Act]] on [[{{Y}}#1964|21 June 1964]], [[Lacan]] introduced the [[cartel]] in the following way:

<blockquote>"Those who enter this School will undertake to fulfil a task that is subject to both internal and external supervision. In exchange they are assured that nothing will be spared in order that anything valuable they do gets the attention it deserves and in the appropriate place. To carry out this work we shall adopt the principle of sustained elaboration in small groups.”</blockquote>

==School==
The [[cartel]] is essentially a study group consisting of ''three'' to ''five'' people (though [[Lacan]] considers ''four'' the optimum number), plus a supervisor (known as a "[[plus-one]]" (''[[plus-un]]'')) who moderates the group's work.  A [[cartel]] is created when a group of people decide to work together on a particular aspect of [[psychoanalytic theory]] which is of interest to them, and it is then registered in the [[school]]'s list of [[cartels]].

==Membership==
Although participation in [[cartels]] plays an important part in the [[training]] (''[[formation]]'') of [[Lacan]]ian [[analysts]], membership of [[cartels]] is not restricted to members of the [[school]].  Indeed, [[Lacan]] welcomed the exchange of ideas between [[analysts]] and those from other disciplines, and saw the [[cartel]] as one [[structure]] which would serve to encourage this exchange.

==IPA==
By organizing research work around a small-scale unit like the [[cartel]], [[Lacan]] hoped to avoid the effects of massification which he regarded as partly to blame for the sterility of the [[International Psycho-Analytical Association]] ([[IPA]]).
