=====Modern Linguistics=====
Most theories of [[communication]] -- offered by modern [[linguistics]] --  are characterised by two important features.

# Firstly, they usually involve a reference to the category of intentionality, which is conceived of as coterminuous with [[consciousness]].
# Secondly, they represent [[communication]] as a simple process in which a [[message]] is sent by one person (the addresser) to another (the addressee).<ref>[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson, Roman]]. (1960) "Linguistics and poetics," in ''Selected Writings'', vol. II, ''Poetry of Grammar and Grammar of Poetry'', The Hague: Mouton, 1981, p. 21</ref>

=====Psychoanalytic Treament=====
However, both these features are put into question by the specific experience of [[communication]] in [[psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]]. 

# Firstly, [[speech]] is revealed to possess an [[intentionality]] that goes beyond [[conscious]] purpose.
# Secondly, the speaker's [[message]] is seen to be not merely directed at another but also at himself.
:<blockquote>"In [[human]] [[speech]] the sender is always a receiver at the same time."<ref>{{S3}} p. 24</ref></blockquote>

=====Unconscious Message=====
Putting these two points together, it can be said that the part of the speaker's [[message]] which is addressed to himself is the [[unconscious]] [[intention]] behind the [[message]].  When speaking to the [[analyst]], the [[analysand]] is also addressing a [[message]] to himself, but is not aware of this. 

=====Analytic Communication=====
The task of the [[analyst]] is to enable the [[analysand]] to hear the [[message]] he is [[unconscious]]ly addressing to himself by [[interpretation|interpreting]] the [[analysand]]'s words, the [[analyst]] permits the [[analysand]]'s [[message]] to return to him in its true, [[unconscious]] dimension. 

Hence [[Lacan]] defines [[communication| analytic communication]] as the [[act]] whereby "the sender receives his own message from the receiver in an inverted form."<ref>{{Ec}} p. 41</ref>
