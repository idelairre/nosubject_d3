'''Ida Bauer''' (1882â€“1945) was a [[hysteria|hysterical]] [[:Category:Famous Patients|patient]] of [[Sigmund Freud]] about whom Freud wrote a "[[Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria]]" (1901), one of his notable early papers, using the psuedonym '[[Dora]]'. Dora's most [[manifest]] hysterical [[symptom]] was [[aphonia]] (loss of voice).

'Dora' remains one of Freud's most famous cases, and is often discussed in [[feminism|feminist]] circles because instead of taking Freud's advice, she rejected his speculations, broke off her therapy and chose instead to confront her tormentors (her father, his lover and his lover's husband). When confronted, her tormentors confessed that she had been right all along, and had not imagined their affairs and motivations.

Though Freud was disappointed with the results of the case, he considered it an important study in the phenomenon of [[transference]].

Freud gave her the name 'Dora' after a maid working in the Freud house by the same name.
