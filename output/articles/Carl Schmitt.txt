In ''The Concept of the Political'' (1932), Carl Schmitt writes: "the specific political distinction to which political actions and motives can be reduced is that between friend and enemy."<ref>Carl Schmitt.  ''The Concept of the Political'', trans. Geroge Schwab. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 26.</ref>

 
In his book ''Political Theology'' (1922), Schmitt presented a quite different, even contradictory logic of the political.

There the structural function of the exception - the sovereign's Godlike ability to declare a state of emergency and act outside the law - implies that the border between the law and lawlessness is permeable and, by extension, that hte realtionship of interiority and exteriority is unstable.
