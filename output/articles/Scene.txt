==Sigmund Freud==
[[Freud]] borrowed the expression "[[another scene]]" ([[German]]: ''[[eine andere Schauplatz]]'') from G.T. Fechner, and used it in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'', stating that "the [[scene]] of [[action]] of [[dream]]s is different from that of waking ideational [[life]]."<ref>{{F}} ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'', 1900a. [[SE]] V. p. 535-6</ref>

This led [[Freud]] to formulate the idea of "[[scene|psychical locality]]".

However, [[Freud]] emphasized that this concept of locality is not to be confused with physical locality or anatomical locality, and [[Lacan]] takes this as a justification for his own use of [[topology]].<ref>{{E}} p. 285</ref>

[[Lacan]] makes repeated reference to Fechner's expression in his work;<ref>{{E}} p. 193</ref> the "other scene" is, in [[Lacan]]ian terms, the [[Other]].

==Jacques Lacan==
==Fantasy==
[[Lacan]] also uses the term "[[scene]]" to denote the [[imaginary]] and [[symbolic]] theatre in which the [[subject]] plays out his [[fantasy]], which is built on the edifice of the [[real]] (the world).

The [[scene]] of [[fantasy]] is a virtual space which is framed, in the same way that the [[scene]] of a play is framed by the proscenium arch in a theatre, whereas the world is a [[real]] space which lies beyond the frame.<ref>{{F}} ''[[Seminar X|Le Séminaire. Livre X. L'angoisse, 1962-63]]'', unpublished. [[Seminar]] of 19 December 1962.</ref>

==Acting Out and the Passage to the Act==
This notion of [[scene]] is used by [[Lacan]] to distinguish between [[acting out]] and [[passage to the act]].

The former still remains inside the [[scene]], for it is still inscribed in the [[symbolic order]].

[[Lacan]] uses the term "[[scene]]" to distinguish between "[[acting out]]" and the "[[passage to the act]]."

It is said that the process of [[acting out]] remains inside the [[scene]], inscribed in the [[symbolic]] [[order]].

The [[passage to the act]], however, is an exit from the [[scene]], is a crossing over from the [[symbolic]] into the [[real]]; there is a total [[identification]] with the [[other]] and hence an abolution of the [[subject]].<ref>{{F}} ''[[Seminar X|Le Séminaire. Livre X. L'angoisse, 1962-63]]'', unpublished. [[Seminar]] of 16 January 1963.</ref> 

==Perversion==
The [[fantasy]] [[scene]] is also an important aspect in [[perversion]]. 

The [[pervert]] typically stages his [[enjoyment]] in terms of some highly stylised [[scene]], and according to a stereotypical script.
