[[Algebra]] is a branch of [[mathematics]] which reduces the solution of problems to manipulations of [[symbolic]] expressions.

==Formalization==
In 1955, [[Lacan]] begins to use [[algebraic]] [[symbol]]s -- in an attempt to [[formalize]] [[psychoanalysis]].

Three main reasons lie behind this attempt at [[formalization]].

:1. [[Formalization]] is necessary for [[psychoanalysis]] to acquire [[scientific]] status.

:Just as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] uses quasi-mathematical formulae in an attempt to set [[anthropology]] on a more [[scientific]] footing, [[Lacan]] attempts to do the same for [[psychoanalysis]]

:[[Lacan]] used quasi-mathematical formulae in an attempt to set [[psychoanalysis]] on a more [[scientific]] footing.

:2. [[Formalization]] can provide a core of [[psychoanalytic theory]] which can be transmitted integrally even to those who have never experienced [[psychoanalytic treatment]].

:The [[matheme|formulae]] thus become an essential aspect of the [[training]] of [[psychoanalysis]] which take their place alongside [[training|training analysis]] as a medium for the transmission of [[psychoanalytic]] [[knowledge]].

:3. [[Formalization]] of [[psychoanalytic theory]] in terms of [[algebraic]] [[symbols]] is a means of preventing [[knowledge|intuitive understanding]], which [[Lacan]] regards as an [[imaginary]] [[lure]] which hinders access to the [[symbolic]].

:Rather than being understood in an intuitive way, the [[algebraic]] [[symbols]] are to be used, manipulated and read in various different ways.<ref>{{E}} p.313</ref>

==List==

The [[algebraic]] [[symbol]]s used by [[Lacan]], which appear principally in the [[matheme]]s, [[schema l]] and the [[graph of desire]], are [[List of Algebraic Symbols|listed here]], together with their most common [[meaning]].

==Development==
It is important to remember that the [[symbol]]s do not always refer to the same concept throughout [[Lacan]]'s work, but are used in different ways as his work develops.  Therefore some caution should be exercised when referring to the list of equivalences above.

==Details==
The typographic details and diacritics are extremely important in [[Lacan]]ian [[algebra]].
The difference between upper- and lower-case [[symbol]]s, the difference between italicised and non-italicised [[symbol]]s, the use of the apostrophe, the minus [[sign]], and subscripts; all these details play their part in the [[algebraic]] system.  For example the upper-case letters usually refer to the [[symbolic]] [[order]], whereas the lower-case letters usually refer to the [[imaginary]].  The use of the [[bar]] is also important.
