The concept of [[narcissistic injury]] does not appear as such in [[Freud]]. 

Since [[Freud]], the theoretical elaboration of [[narcissism]] and the development of new entities of [[psychopathology]] has led to the creation of this concept to describe the consequences, on the [[narcissistic]] level, of a [[trauma]] to the [[psychic]] [[apparatus]] arising from [[internal]] or [[external]] factors.

It should be remarked, however, that the introduction of the concept of [[narcissism]] (1914) prepared the way in meta[[psychology]] for the notion of [[narcissistic injury]], if one also takes into account the [[Freud]]ian propositions concerning the [[development]] of the [[ego]] in relation to the exigencies of the [[reality principle]], and his ideas about [[infantile]] [[helplessness]] (''[[Hilflosigkeit]]'').<ref>Freud. 1911b.</ref>

On the one hand, conflicting [[drive]]s, and, on the other, the [[object]] and its vicissitudes inflict a series of [[trauma]]s on [[narcissism]], whereby the anguish linked to [[loss]] and/or [[separation]] becomes [[structural]]. 

Thereby, [[birth]], [[weaning]], [[anal]]ity, the [[castration complex]], and the [[fear]] of [[death]] are all prototypical phenomena that give rise to [[narcissistic injuries]].

Further reflection on [[narcissism]], and the post-[[Freudian]] [[clinic]], have led to theories in which the notion of [[narcissistic injury]] occupies a central place, as well as to developments and modifications in [[psychoanalytic]] [[technique]]. 

In the [[United States]], the "Self Psychology" of Heinz Kohut and the description of borderline states and narcissistic personalities by Otto Kernberg have made this category central, allowing the evaluation of psychic organization and serving as [[transference]]-[[countertransference]] guide in the course of the [[analysis]]. 

Heinz Kohut particularly has stressed the significance of "narcissistic rage" as a reaction to [[narcissistic injury]]: faced with the failure of the [[self]]-[[object]], narcissistic rage would be the aggressive result of [[shame]].

In France, BÃ©la Grunberger considered that [[narcissistic injury]], inflicted on the [[ego]] by the vicissitudes of a disappointed [[ego-ideal]], is an integral part of [[narcissism]]; accordingly, this theory made [[narcissistic injury]] a pivotal notion, since the [[impotence]] inherent in the [[human condition]] constitutes, in itself and from the outset, a [[narcissistic injury]], one that is preponderant subsequently in the [[dialectic]] between [[narcissism]] and the [[drive]]s, as well as being the source of [[ethics]] and [[civilization]]. 

Andre Green, stressing the role of the [[object]], speaks of [[object]] [[trauma]], whose very [[existence]] is the cause of [[injury]], calling for never-completed reparation.

The notion of [[narcissistic injury]] is useful in accounting for the rapports between [[narcissism]], the [[drive]]s, and the [[object]]. 

However, as critics of Kohut point out, its excessively univocal [[development]] risks de-emphasizing [[sexuality]].
