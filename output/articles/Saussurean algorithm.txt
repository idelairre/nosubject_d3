[[Image:SAUSSUREANSIGN.gif|thumb|300px|right|The Saussurean Sign]]
According to [[Saussure]], the [[sign]] is the basic unit of [[language]]

The [[sign]] is constituted by two elements: 
# a conceptual element (which [[Saussure]] calls the [[signified]]), and 
# a phonological element (called the [[signifier]]). 

The two elements are linked by an arbitrary but unbreakable bond.

=====Saussurean Sign=====
[[Saussure]] represented the [[sign]] by means of a diagram.<ref>[[Saussure|Saussure, Ferdinand de]]. (1916) ''[[Saussure|Course in General Linguistics]]'', ed. Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye, trans. Wade Baskin, Glasgow: Collins Fontana. p.114</ref>

In this diagram, the line between the [[signified]] and the [[signifier]] represents union, the reciprocal implication of the two elements.

=====Jacques Lacan=====
[[Lacan]] takes up the [[Saussure]]an concept of the [[sign]] in his "linguistic turn" in [[psychoanalysis]] during the 1950s, but subjects it to several modifications.

=====Relation between Signifier and Signified=====
Firstly, whereas [[Saussure]] posited the reciprocal implication between [[signifier]] and [[signified]] (they are as mutually interdependent as two sides of a sheet of paper), [[Lacan]] argues that the relation between [[signifier]] and [[signified]] is extremely unstable. 

=====Primacy of the Signifier=====
Secondly, [[Lacan]] asserts the [[existence]] of an order of "pure signifiers," where [[signifier]]s exist prior to [[signified]]s; this [[order]] of purely logical [[structure]] is the [[unconscious]]. 

This amounts to a destruction of [[Saussure]]'s concept of the [[sign]]; for [[Lacan]], a [[language]] is not composed of [[sign]]s but of [[signifier]]s.

=====Saussurean algorithm=====
[[Image:SAUSSUREANALGORITHM.gif|right|thumb|Saussurean algorithm|The Saussurean algorithm]]

To illustrate the contrast between his own views and those of [[Saussure]], [[Lacan]] replaces [[Saussure]]'s diagram of the [[sign]] with an [[Saussurean algorithm|algorithm]] which, [[Lacan]] argues, should be attributed to [[Saussure]] -- and is thus now sometimes referred to as the "[[Saussure]]an algorithm."<ref>{{E}} p.149</ref>

The '''S''' stands for the [[signifier]], and the '''s''' for the [[signified]]; the position of the [[signified]] and the [[signifier]] is thus inverted, showing the primacy of the [[signifier]] (which is capitalized, whereas the [[signifier]] is reduced to mere lower-case italic). 

The arrows and the circle are abolished, representing the [[absence]] of a stable or fixed relation between [[signifier]] and [[signified]]. 

The [[bar]] between the [[signifier]] and the [[signified]] no longer represents union but the [[resistance]] inherent in [[signification]]. 

For [[Lacan]], this [[algorithm]] defines "the [[topography]] of the [[unconscious]]."<ref>{{E}} p.163</ref>
