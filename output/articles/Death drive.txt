==Sigmund Freud==
[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] introduced the concept of the [[death drive]] in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'' (1920).

Here he established a fundamental opposition between [[death drive|life drive]]s (''[[eros]]''), conceived of as a tendency towards cohesion and unity, and the [[death drive]]s, which operate in the opposite direction, undoing connections and destroying things.

The concept of the [[death drive]] was one of the most controversial [[:category:concepts|concepts]] introduced by [[Freud]], and many of his disciples rejected it, but [[Freud]] continued to reaffirm the concept for the rest of his life. 

==Jacques Lacan==
===Psychoanalysis===
[[Lacan]] follows [[Freud]] in reaffirming the concept of the [[death drive]] as central to [[psychoanalysis]]: 
<blockquote>"To ignore the death instinct in his [Freud's] doctrine is to misunderstand that doctrine entirely."<ref>{{E}} p. 301</ref></blockquote>

===Nostalgia===
In [[Lacan]]'s first remarks on the [[death drive]], in 1938, he describes it as a [[nostalgia]] for a [[preoedipal|lost harmony]], a [[desire]] to [[return]] to the [[preoedipal|preoedipal fusion]] with the [[mother]]'s [[breast]], the [[castration|loss]] of which is marked on the [[psyche]] in the [[complex|weaning complex]].<ref>{{1938}} p. 35</ref>

===Narcissism===
In 1946 he links the [[death drive]] to the [[narcissism|suicidal tendency]] of [[narcissism]].<ref>{{Ec}} p. 186</ref>. 

By linking the [[death drive]] with the [[preoedipal phase]] and with [[narcissism]], these early remarks would place the [[death drive]] in what [[Lacan]] later comes to call the [[imaginary order]].

===Symbolic Order===
However, when [[Lacan]] begins to develop his concept of the [[order|three orders]] of [[imaginary]], [[symbolic]] and [[real]], in the 1950s, he does not situate the [[death drive]] in the [[imaginary]] but in the [[symbolic]]. 

===Repetition===
In the [[seminar]] of 1954-5, for example, he argues that the [[death drive]] is simply the fundamental tendency of the [[symbolic order]] to produce [[repetition]]:

<blockquote>"The [[death drive|death instinct]] is only the mask of the [[symbolic order]]."<ref>{{S2}} p. 326</ref></blockquote>

===Biological Instincts===
This shift also marks a difference with [[Freud]], for whom the [[death drive]] was closely bound up with [[biology]], representing the fundamental tendency of every living thing to return to an inorganic state. 

By situating the [[death drive]] firmly in the [[symbolic]], [[Lacan]] articulates it with culture rather than [[nature]]; he states that the [[death drive]] "is not a question of biology,"<ref>{{E}} p. 102</ref>, and must be distinguished from the [[biological]] [[instinct]] to return to the inanimate.<ref>{{S7}} p. 211-12</ref>

===Sexual Drives===
Another difference between [[Lacan]]'s concept of the [[death drive]] and [[Freud]]'s emerges in 1964. 

[[Freud]] opposed the [[death drive]] to the [[sexual]] [[drive]]s, but now [[Lacan]] argues that the [[death drive]] is not a separate [[drive]], but is in fact an aspect of every [[drive]]. 

<blockquote>"The distinction between the [[death drive|life drive]] and the [[death drive]] is - true in as much as it manifests two aspects of the [[drive]]."<ref>{{S11}} p. 257</ref></blockquote>

Hence [[Lacan]] writes that "every [[drive]] is virtually a [[death drive]]" because:
# every [[drive]] pursues its own extinction, 
# every [[drive]] involves the subject in [[repetition]], and 
# every [[drive]] is an attempt to go beyond the [[pleasure principle]], to the realm of [[excess]] ''[[jouissance]]'' where [[enjoyment]] is experienced as [[sadism|suffering]].<ref>{{Ec}} p. 844</ref>
