<blockquote>We do not, indeed, wish to decry words. They are a mighty instrument, the means by which we convey our feelings, the way by which we influence others. Words can do unutterable good, and appalling harm. No doubt, in the beginning was the deed-the word came later; in some contexts it was a cultural advance when deeds were moderated to words. But still, words were originally spells, acts of magic, and they still retain much of their old power.<ref>{{QLA}} Ch. 1</ref></blockquote>
