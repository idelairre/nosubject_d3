<h3 align="center">REFERENCE DEALING WITH INFANTILE SEXUALITY</h3><p>
<br>
<font color="#000000" face="Times Roman" size="3">The characteristics of infantile sexual life which we have<br>
hitherto emphasized are the facts that it is essentially auto-<br>
erotic (i.e. that it finds its object in the infant's own body) and<br>
that its individual component instincts are upon the whole dis-<br>
connected and independent of one another in their search for<br>

pleasure. The final outcome of sexual development lies in what<br>
is known as the normal sexual life of the adult, in which the<br>
pursuit of pleasure comes under the sway of the reproductive<br>
function and in which the component instincts, under the<br>
primacy of a single erotogenic zone, form a firm organization<br>
directed towards a sexual aim attached to some extraneous<br>
sexual object.</font></p><p><br>

PREGENITAL   ORGANIZATIONS  <br>

<br>
     

The study, with the help of psycho-analysis,<br>
of the inhibitions and disturbances of this pro-<br>
cess of development enables us to recognize<br>
abortive beginnings and preliminary stages of a firm organiza-<br>
tion of the component instincts such as this‹preliminary stages<br>
which themselves constitute a sexual régime of a sort. These<br>
phases of sexual organization are normally passed throug<br>
smoothly, without giving more than a hint of their exist-<br>

ence. It is only in pathological cases that they become active<br>
and recognizable to superficial observation.<br><br>

     We shall give the name of 'pregenital' to organizations of<br>
sexual life in which the genital zones have not yet taken over<br>
their predominant part. We have hitherto identified two such<br>
organizations, which almost seem as though they were harking<br>
back to early animal forms of life.<br><br>

     The first of these is the oral or, as it might be called, cannibal-<br>
lstlc pregenital sexual organization. Here sexual activity has<br>
not yet been separated from the ingestion of food; nor are<br>
opposite currents within the activity differentiated. The object<br>
of both activities is the same; the sexual aim consists in the in-<br>
corporation of the object‹the prototype of a process which, in<br>
the form of identification, is later to play such an important<br>
psychological part. A relic of this constructed phase of organiza-<br>

tion, which is forced upon our notice by pathology, may be seen<br>
in thumb-sucking, in which the sexual activity, detached from<br>
the nutritive activity, has substituted for the extraneous object<br>
one situated in the subject's own body.<br><br>

     A second pregenital phase is that of the sadistic-anal organiza-<br>
tion. Here the opposition between two currents, which runs<br>
through all sexual life, is already developed: they cannot yet,<br>
however, be described as 'masculine' and 'feminine', but only<br>

as 'active' and 'passive'. The activity is put into operation by the<br>
instinct for mastery through the agency of the somatic muscula-<br>
ture; the organ which, more than any other, represents the<br>
<i>passivc</i> sexual aim is the erotogenic mucous membrane of the<br>
anus. Both of these currents have objects, which, however, are<br>
not identical. Alongside these, other component instincts oper-<br>
ate in an auto-erotic manner. In this phase, therefore, sexual<br>
polarity and an extraneous object are already observable.  But<br>

organization and subordination to the reproductive function <br>
are still absent.<br>
