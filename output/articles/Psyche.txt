===Agencies===
In [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s theory of the [[mind]], the [[mind|psychical apparatus]] was differentiated into a number of systems of "[[agency|agencies]]", each of which had distinct properties and functions, but which interacted dynamically and in conflict with each other.

Two of these [[agency|agencies]] can be identified in [[Sigmund Freud:Bibliography|Freud's writings]].

===First and Second Topography===
The first theory, dating from about 1900 - the "[[first topography]]" - distinguishes between the [[unconscious]], [[preconscious]] and [[conscious]], while the "[[second topography]]", dating from [[{{Y}}|1923]], differentiates the three [[agency|agencies]] of [[id]], [[ego]], and [[superego|super-ego]] (''[[Das Es]]'', ''[[Das Ich]]'', ''[[Das Ãœber-ich]]'').

There is overlap between these two models, e.g., the [[ego]] and [[superego|super-ego]] are partly [[preconscious]] and partly [[unconscious]].
