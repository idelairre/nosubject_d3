=====Jacques Lacan=====
=====Early Work=====
While [[Lacan]]s interest in [[language]] can be traced back to the early 1930s, when he analyzed the [[writing]]s of a [[psychotic]] [[woman]] in his doctoral dissertation, it is only in the early 1950s that he begins to articulate his views of [[language]] in terms derived from a specific [[linguistics|linguistic theory]], and not until 1957 that he begins to engage with [[linguistics]] in any detail.

=====Structural Linguistics=====
=====Claude Lévi-Strauss=====
[[Lacan]]'s "linguistic turn" was inspired by the [[anthropology|anthropological]] work of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] who, in the 1940s, had begun to apply the methods of [[structure|structural]] [[linguistics]] to non-linguistic cultural data (myth, kinship relations, etc.), thus giving brith to "structural anthropology."

In so doing, [[Lévi-Strauss]] announced an ambitious programme, in which [[linguistics]] would provide a paradigm of [[science|scientificity]] for all the social sciences:

<blockquote>"Structural linguistics will certainly play the same renovating role with respect to the social sciences that nuclear physics, for example, has played for the physical sciences."<ref>[[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss, Claude]]. 1945. "Structural analysis in linguistics and in anthropology," in ''Structural Anthropology'', trans. Claire Jacobson and Brooke Grundfest Schoepf, New York: Basic Books, 1963. p.33</ref></blockquote>

=====Jacques Lacan=====
=====Psychoanalytic Theory=====
Following the indications of [[Lévi-Strauss]], [[Lacan]] turns to [[linguistics]] to provide [[psychoanalytic theory]] with a conceptual rigour that it previously lacked.

The reason for this lack of conceptual rigour was simply due, [[Lacan]] argues, to the fact that [[linguistics|structural linguistics]] appeared too late for [[Freud]] to make use of it.

=====Sigmund Freud=====
However, [[Lacan]] argues that when [[Freud]] is reread in the light of [[linguistics|linguistic theory]], a coherent logic is revealed which is not otherwise apparent; indeed, [[Freud]] can even be seen to have anticipated certain elements of modern [[linguistics|linguistic theory]].<ref>{{E}} p.162</ref>

=====Structural Linguistics=====
[[Lacan]]'s engagement with [[linguistics]] revolves almost entirely aorund the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Roman Jakobson]].

=====Ferdinand de Saussure=====
[[Saussure]] was the founder of "[[linguistics|structural linguistics]]."

=====Diachronic and Synchronic=====
In contrast to the study of [[language]] in the nineteenth century, which had been exclusively "[[diachronic]]" (i.e. focusing exclusively on the ways that [[language]]s change over [[time]]), [[Saussure]] argued that linguists should also be "[[synchronic]]" (i.e. focus on the state of a [[language]] at a given point in [[time]]).

=====''Langue'' and ''Parole''=====
=====Concept of the Sign=====
This led him to develop his famous distinction between ''[[langue]]'' and ''[[parole]]'', and his concept of the [[sign]] as composed of two elements: [[signifier]] and [[signified]].

====="Course in General Linguistics"=====
All these ideas are developed in [[Saussure]]'s most famous work, the "Course in General Linguistics," which was constructed by his students from notes they had taken at [[Saussure]]'s lectures at the Unviersity of Geneva and published three years after his death.<ref>[[Saussure|Saussure, Ferdinand de]]. (1916) ''[[Saussure|Course in General Linguistics]]'', ed. Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye, trans. Wade Baskin, Glasgow: Collins Fontana. p.114</ref>

=====Roman Jakobson=====
[[Jakobson]] further developed the line laid down by [[Saussure]], pioneering the development of phonology, as well as making important contributions to the fields of grammatical semantics, pragmatics and poetics.

=====Jacques Lacan=====
=====Language as Structure, System of Signifiers=====
From [[Saussure]], [[Lacan]] borrows the concepts of [[language]] as a [[structure]], although whereas [[Saussure]] had conceived it as a system of [[sign]]s, [[Lacan]] conceives it as a system of [[signifier]]s.

=====Metaphor and Metonymy=====
From [[Jakobson]], [[Lacan]] borrows the concepts of [[metaphor]] and [[metonymy]] as the two axes ([[synchronic]] and [[diachronic]]) along which all [[linguistics|linguistic phenomena]] are aligned, using these terms to understand [[Freud]]'s concepts of [[condensation]] and [[displacement]].

=====Other Linguistics Concepts=====
Other concepts which [[Lacan]] takes from [[linguistics]] are those of the [[shifter]], and the distinction betwen the [[statement]] and the [[enunciation]].

=====Linguistics and Psychoanalytic Theory=====
=====Psychoanalytic Use of Linguistic Concepts=====
In his borrowing of [[linguistic]] [[:category:concepts|concepts]], [[Lacan]] has been accused of grossly distorting them.

[[Lacan]] responds to such criticisms by arguing that he is not doing [[linguistics]] but [[psychoanalysis]], and this requires a certain modification of the concepts borrowed from [[linguistics]].

In the end, [[Lacan]] is not really interested in [[linguistics|linguistic theory]] in itself, but only in the ways it can be used to develop [[psychoanalytic theory]].<ref>{{L}} ''[[Seminar XVIII|Le Seminaire. Livre XVIII. D'un discours qui ne serait pas du semblant, 1970-71]]'', unpublished. [[Seminar]] of 27 January 1971.</ref>

It was this that led [[Lacan]] to coin the neologism ''[[linguistics|linguistérie]]'' (from the words ''[[linguistics|linguistique]]'' and ''[[hysteria|hystérie]]'') to refer to his psychoanalytic use of linguistic concepts.<ref>{{S20}} p. 20</ref>

----

In seminar XX Lacan formulated this distinction between his own use of the term 'language' and linguistics through the neologism ''[[la linguisterie]]''. 

Linguistics is concerned with the formalization of language and knowledge. 

''[[La linguisterie]]'' on the other hand is the side of language that linguistics ignores. 

It refers to those points in language when meaning fails and breaks down; it is the science of the word that fails. 

Fink rather nicely translates ''[[la linguisterie]]'' as 'linguistricks', which serves to emphasize the playfulness of the unconscious and the way it is always trying to trip the subject up, playing tricks on conscious thought. 

It is in this sense and not in the sense of formal linguistics that the unconscious is structured like a language.
