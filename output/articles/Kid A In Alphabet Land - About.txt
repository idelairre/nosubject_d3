== An Introduction To The Electronic Edition ==
This is the electronic edition of ''Kid A In Alphabet Land'', "an abecedarian roller coaster ride through the phallocentric obscurantism of Jacques Lacan."
''Kid A In Alphabet Land'' was originally designed as a tangible trading card set, and, as such, works best in that medium. This electronic edition of ''Kid A In Alphabet Land'' is intended to bring the set to a wider audience than it otherwise might reach. I've considered linking the in-line graphics to larger-size, better-quality external images, and creating hypertext links to and from related concepts and to more detailed explanations of the Lacanian concepts and cultural references involved; currently and in the foreseeable future, however, my time doesn't allow such an undertaking.

Sometimes even I have trouble understanding my own repo job of Freudian psychoanalysis. But, thanks to Kid A In Alphabet Land, I'm able to tell my father's name apart from, say, an upholstery button, and still have time to play checkers and Parcheesi with the Paris intellectual community!

== About The Authors ==
[[Image:Kida about.gif |right|frame]]

Carl Steadman's alter ego is Kid A In Alphabet Land. Mild-mannered Carl conceived, wrote, and
designed ''Kid A In Alphabet Land'', and he did it all for you.
Andra Brubaker is not only a ruinous femme fatale, she's also illustrator for ''Kid A In Alphabet Land''.  She's collaborated with Carl on other projects, including the ''Procter &amp; Gamble Coloring Book'' and ''[http://www.ratstocats.com Rats To Cats]''!
Michael Herman, not related to Pee-wee, but guilty of the same crimes, contributed the text to S. Had things gone differently, S might have been the secret, but then the secret is, after all, that there is no secret.

Special thanks to Jochen Schulte-Sasse, who didn't encourage us, but didn't discourage us (this would change later, of course), and to Slavoj Zizek, who, at first, "didn't know about these," which was a true statement, but flattering nonetheless.
