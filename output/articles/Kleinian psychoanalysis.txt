==School of Psychoanalysis==
[[Kleinian psychoanalysis]] is the name given to the [[school]] of [[psychoanalytic theory]] that has grown up around the pioneering work of the Austrian [[psychoanalyst]] [[Melanie Klein]] (1882-1960).

==Melanie Klein==
Born in Vienna, [[Klein]] settled in England in 1926 and remained there for the rest of her life.

[[Kleinian psychoanalysis]] first began to emerge as a distinctive [[school]] of [[psychoanalytic theory]] during the 1940s in opposition to the group which gathered around [[Anna Freud]] after the latter's move to London.

However, it was not until after the war that other [[analyst]]s began to become known as "[[Kleinian]]s" and to develop a substantial body of [[Klein]]ian [[thought]].

These [[analysts]] included Hannal Segal, Herbet Rosenfeld, Wilfred Bion and (later) Donald Meltzer.

==Jacques Lacan==
Along with the two other major non-[[Lacanian]] [[school]]s of [[psychoanalytic theory]] ([[ego-psychology]] and [[object-relations theory]]) [[Kleinian psychoanalysis]] forms a major point of reference for [[Lacan]] against which he puts forward his own particular reading of [[Freud]].

[[Lacan]]'s criticisms of [[Klein]] are therefore important to understanding the originality of his position.

==Criticism==
While it is impossible to mention all of these criticisms here, some of the most important of them may be summarized as follows.

* [[Lacan]] criticizes [[Klein]] for placing too much emphasis on the [[mother]] and neglecting the role of the [[father]].<ref>{{Ec}} p. 728-9</ref>

* [[Lacan]] criticizes [[Klein]] for theorizing [[fantasy]] entirely in the [[imaginary]] [[order]]. 
: Such an approach is a misconception, argues [[Lacan]], since it fails to take into account the [[symbolic]] [[structure]] that underpins all [[imaginary]] [[formation]]s.

* [[Lacan]] disagrees with [[Klein]]'s views on the early development of the [[Oedipus complex]]. 
: For [[Lacan]], all debate on the precise dating of the [[Oedipus complex]] is futile, since it is not primarily a [[stage]] of [[development]] but a permanent [[structure]] of [[subject]]ivity. 
: (Insofar as the [[Oedipus complex]] can be located in time, [[Lacan]] would not locate it as early as [[Klein]] does. 
: Thus while [[Klein]] seems almost to deny the [[existence]] of a [[Preoedipal_stage|preoedipal phase]], [[Lacan]] argues that there is one.)

* Closely connected to the preceding point are [[Lacan]]'s differences with respect to "Melanie Klein's encroachments into the pre-verbal areas of the unconscious."<ref>{{L}} "[[Works of Jacques Lacan|Some Reflections on the Ego]]", ''Int. J. Psycho-Anal''., vol. 34, 1953: p. 11</ref>
: For [[Lacan]], there are no [[pre-oedipal phase|pre-verbal]] areas of the [[unconscious]], since the [[unconscious]] is a [[linguistic]] [[structure]].

* [[Lacan]] criticizes [[Klein]]'s interpretive style as being particularly brutal. 
: In reference to the young [[patient]] ('Dick') whom [[Klein]] discusses in her paper on symbol formation, [[Lacan]] remarks that "she slams the symbolism on him with complete brutality."<ref>{{S1}} p. 68</ref>

==Other Schools==
However, to portray [[Lacan]] as entirely critical of [[Klein]] would be to oversimplify the matter.

For while [[Lacan]]'s disagreements with [[Kleinian psychoanalysis]] are at least as great as his disagreement with [[ego-psychology]] and [[object-relations theory]], his comments on [[Klein]] are not characterized by the same dismissive tone which is evident in his acerbic criticisms of [[analyst]]s from these other two [[school]]s.

He certainly regards it as superior to [[ego-psychology]].

He also states that [[Melanie Klein]] is certainly more faithful to [[Freud]] than [[Anna Freud]] regarding the theory of [[transference]].<ref>{{S8}} p. 369</ref>

In his pre-1950s writings, there are many allusions to [[Klein]]'s work on the [[mother]]-[[child]] [[dual relation|relationship]] and the various [[imago]]s that operate in [[fantasy]].

After 1950, [[Lacan]] praises [[Klein]] for emphasizing te importance of the [[death drive]] in [[psychoanalytic theory]] and for developing the concept of the [[part-object]] (though [[Lacan]]'s formulations on this concept different greatly from [[Klein]]'s).
