<i>What Might Have Been: Imaginary History from 12 Leading Historians</i>  ed. Andrew Roberts.

Why is the flourishing genre of ‘what if?’ [[histories]] the preserve of [[conservative]] [[historians]]?  The introduction to such volumes typically begins with an attack on [[Marxists]], who allegedly believe in [[historical determinism]].  Take this latest instalment, edited by Andrew Roberts, who has himself contributed an essay on the bright prospects that would have faced [[Russia]] in the 20th century had [[Lenin]] been shot on arriving at the Finland Station.  One of Roberts’s arguments in favour of this kind of history is that ‘anything that has been condemned by Carr, Thompson and Hobsbawm must have something to recommend it.’  He believes that the ideals of [[liberté]], [[égalité]], [[fraternité]] ‘have time and again been shown to be completely mutually exclusive’.  ‘If,’ he continues, ‘we accept that there is no such thing as historical inevitability and that nothing is preordained, political lethargy – one of the scourges of our day – should be banished, since it means that in human affairs anything is possible.’

This is [[empirically]] not the case.  Roberts ignores the central [[ideological]] [[paradox]] of [[modern]] [[history]], as formulated by [[Max Weber]] in <em>[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]].</em>  In contrast to [[Catholicism]], which conceived of human redemption as being dependent on good deeds, [[Protestantism]] insisted on [[predestination]]: why then did [[Protestantism]] function as the [[ideology]] of early [[capitalism]]?  Why did [[people]]’s [[belief]] that their redemption had been decided in advance not only not lead to lethargy, but sustain the most powerful mobilisation of human resources ever experienced?

The [[conservative]] sympathies of the ‘what if?’ volumes become clear as soon as you look at their contents pages.  The topics tend to concern how much better history would have been if some revolutionary or ‘radical’ event had been avoided (if Charles I had won the Civil War; if the English had won the war against the American colonies; if the Confederacy had won the American Civil War; if Germany had won the Great War) or, less often, how much worse history would have been if it had taken a more progressive turn.  There are two examples of the latter in Roberts’s volume: had Thatcher been killed in the Brighton bombing of 1984; had Gore been president on 9/11 (in this last essay, written by the neo-con David Frum, any pretence to serious history is abandoned in favour of political propaganda masked as satire).  No wonder Roberts refers approvingly to Kingsley Amis’s novel <em>Russian Hide-and-Seek</em>, which is set in a Soviet-occupied Britain.

So what should the [[Marxist]]’s answer be?  Definitely not to rehash [[Georgi Plekhanov]]’s dreary thoughts about the ‘[[role of the individual in history]]’ (had [[Napoleon]] never been born, someone else would have had to play a similar role, because the deeper [[historical necessity]] called for a passage to [[Bonapartism]]).  I would rather question the premise that [[Marxist]]s (and [[left]]ists in general) are dumb [[determinist]]s who can’t entertain alternative scenarios.

The first thing to note is that ‘what if?’ [[history]] is part of a more general trend, one which takes issue with linear [[narrative]] and sees life as a multiform flow.  The ‘hard’ [[science]]s seem to be haunted by the randomness of life and possible alternative versions of [[reality]]: as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] put it, ‘wind back the [[film]] of life and play it again.  The [[history]] of [[evolution]] will be totally different.’  This [[perception]] of our [[reality]] as only one of the possible outcomes of an ‘open’ situation, the notion that other possible outcomes continue to haunt our ‘true’ [[reality]], conferring on it an extreme fragility and [[contingency]], is by no means alien to [[Marxism]].  Indeed, the felt urgency of the [[revolution]]ary [[act]] relies on it.

Since the non-occurrence of the [[October Revolution]] is a favourite topic of ‘what if?’ historians, it’s worth looking at how [[Lenin]] himself related to counterfactuality.  He was as far as he could be from any reliance on ‘[[historical necessity]]’.  On the contrary, it was his [[Menshevik]] opponents who emphasised the [[impossibility]] of omitting one of the stages prescribed by [[historical determinism]]: first [[bourgeois]]-[[democratic]], then [[proletarian]] [[revolution]].  When, in his ‘[[April Theses]]’ of 1917, [[Lenin]] claimed that this was the <em>[[Augenblick]]</em>, the unique opportunity to start a [[revolution]], his proposal was at first met with stupefaction or contempt by a large majority of his party colleagues.  But he had understood that the opportunity was provided by a unique combination of circumstances: if the moment wasn’t seized, the chance would be forfeited, perhaps for decades.  [[Lenin]] was entertaining an alternative scenario: what if we don’t act now?  It was precisely his awareness of the catastrophic consequences of not acting that impelled him to act.

There is a much deeper commitment to alternative histories in the radical [[Marxist]] view.  For a radical Marxist, the actual [[history]] that we live is itself the realisation of an alternative history: we have to live in it because, in the past, we failed to seize the moment.  In an outstanding reading of [[Walter Benjamin]]’s ‘[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]’ (which [[Benjamin]] never published), [[Eric Santner]] elaborated the notion that a present [[revolution]]ary intervention [[repeats]]/redeems failed attempts in the past.  These attempts count as ‘[[symptom]]s’, and can be retroactively redeemed through the ‘[[miracle]]’ of the [[revolutionary]] [[act]].  They are ‘not so much forgotten deeds, but rather forgotten <em>[[failures]]</em> to act, failures to <em>[[suspend]]</em> the force of social bonds inhibiting acts of [[solidarity]] with [[society]]’s “[[other]]s”’:

<blockquote>[[Symptom]]s register not only past [[failed]] [[revolutionary]] attempts but, more modestly, past <em>failures to respond</em> to calls for action or even for empathy on behalf of those whose suffering in some sense belongs to the form of life of which one is a part.  They hold the place of something that is <em>there</em>, that <em>insists</em> in our life, though it has never achieved full ontological consistency. Symptoms are thus in some sense the virtual archives of voids – or, perhaps better, defences against voids – that persist in historical experience.</blockquote>

For [[Santner]], these [[symptom]]s can also take the form of perturbations of ‘normal’ social life: participation, for example, in the [[obscene]] [[ritual]]s of a reigning [[ideology]].  In this way of thinking, [[Kristallnacht]] – a half-organised, half-spontaneous outburst of [[violent]] attacks on homes, synagogues, businesses and individuals – becomes a [[Bakhtin]]ian [[carnival]], a [[symptom]] whose fury and [[violence]] revealed it as an attempt at ‘[[defence-formation]]’, a covering up of a previous failure to intervene effectively in [[Germany]]’s social crisis.  In other words, the very [[violence]] of the [[pogrom]]s was proof of the possibility of an authentic [[proletarian]] [[revolution]], its excessive energy marking the reaction to an ([[unconscious]]) awareness of the missed opportunity.  And is not the ultimate source of [[Ostalgie]] ([[nostalgia]] for the [[Communist]] past) among many intellectuals (and ordinary people) from the defunct [[German Democratic Republic]] also a longing not so much for the [[Communist]] past, but rather for what that past might have been, for the missed opportunity of creating an alternative [[Germany]]?

The post-[[Communist]] outbreaks of [[neo-Nazi]] [[violence]] can also be understood as [[symptom]]atic outbursts of rage, displaying an awareness of missed opportunities.  A parallel can be drawn with the [[psychic]] life of the [[individual]]: in just the same way as the awareness of a missed private opportunity (of a fulfilling [[love]] affair, perhaps) often leaves its traces in the form of [[irrational]] [[anxieties]], headaches and fits of rage, so the [[void]] of a missed [[revolution]]ary opportunity can result in [[irrational]] fits of [[destruction]].

The ‘what if?’ dimension goes to the core of the [[Marxist]] [[revolutionary]] project. In his ironic comments on the [[French Revolution]], [[Marx]] opposed revolutionary enthusiasm and the sobering ‘[[morning after]]’: the actual outcome of the [[sublime]] revolutionary explosion which promised [[liberté]], [[égalité]], [[fraternité]] is the miserable [[utilitarian]]/[[egotistical]] universe of [[market]] calculation.  (This gap was even wider in the case of the [[October Revolution]].)  [[Marx]]’s point, however, is not the commonsensical one, that the vulgar [[reality]] of commerce turns out to be the ‘[[truth]] of the theatre of revolutionary enthusiasm’ – what all the fuss was about.  In the revolutionary explosion, another [[utopian]] dimension shines through, that of [[universal emancipation]], which is in fact the ‘[[excess]]’ betrayed by the [[market]] [[reality]] that takes over on the [[morning after]].  This [[excess]] is not simply abolished or dismissed as irrelevant, but is, as it were, transposed into the [[virtual]] state, as a [[dream]] waiting to be realised.
