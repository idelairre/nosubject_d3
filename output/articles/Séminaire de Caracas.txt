1980-LE SEMINAIRE DE CARACAS (THE SEMINAR IN CARACAS)-1981 

In July 1980, in Caracas, a meeting on Jacques Lacan's teaching and on psy�choanalysis in Latin America took place. Lacan said a few words, in which he alluded to the dissolution, talked about "my family" lies miens] and an�nounced the creation of "my Freudian cause." The importance of the meeting lay in his presence, which guaranteed its legitimacy, at a time of dissensions. L'Ane. the journal of the E.C.P., devoted its first issue to Lacan, to his ecoles, and to the events of 1980. It even included a summary of a discussion with Catherine Millot about death. 

"It is up to you to be Lacanians. As far as I am concerned, I am a Freud�ian." Still, Lacan clearly marked the difference between the two theories.
