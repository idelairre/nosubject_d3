==Jacques Lacan==
[[Lacan]] coined the term "[[factor c]]" at a psychiatric congress in 1950. 

==Culture==
[[Factor c]] is "the constant characteristic of any given cultural milieu"<ref>{{E}} p.37</ref>: it is an attempt to designate that part of the [[symbolic order]] which marks the particular features of one [[culture]] as opposed to another ('''c''' stands for [[culture]]). 

=="American Way of Life"==
Although it would be interesting to speculate on the possible applications of this concept to the interrelationship between different cultural milieux and [[psychoanalysis]], [[Lacan]] only gives one example of the [[c factor]]; ahistoricism, he argues, is the [[factor c|''c'' factor]] of the [[culture]] of the United States.<ref>{{E}} p.37, 115</ref> 

The "American way of life" revolves around such [[signifier]]s as "happiness," "adaptation," "human relations" and "human engineering."<ref>{{E}} p.38</ref> 

==Psychoanalysis==
[[Lacan]] regards the [[factor c|''c'' factor]] of United States culture as particularly antithetical to [[psychoanalysis]], and sees it as largely responsible for the errors which have beset [[psychoanalytic theory]] in the USA (such as [[ego-psychology]]).
