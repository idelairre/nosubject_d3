==Definition==
The term "[[introjection]]" was coined by [[Sándor Ferenczi]] in 1909, in order to denote the opposite of [[projection]].<ref>Ferenczi, Sándor. "Introjection and Transference," 1909, in ''Sex in Psychoanalysis'', New York: Basic Books, pp. 35-57.</ref>

==Sigmund Freud==
[[Freud]] took up the term soon afterwards, arguing that the "purified pleasure-ego" is constituted by the [[introjection]] of everything that is a source of [[pleasure]].<ref>{{F}} "[[Works of Sigmund Freud|Instincts and their Vicissitudes]]," 1915c. [[SE]] XIV, 111.</ref>

==Melanie Klein==
[[Melanie Klein]] uses the term a great deal, but restricts the term to the [[introjection]] of ''[[object]]s''.

==Jacques Lacan==
[[Lacan]] criticizes the way [[psychoanalysts]] have tended to adopt "magical" views of [[introjection]], which confuse it with [[introjection|incorporation]], thus mixing up the orders of [[fantasy]] and [[structure]].<ref>{{S1}} p. 169</ref>

Thus [[Lacan]] rejects the [[Klein]]ian imagery in which [[introjection|introjects]] are internal [[object]]s which pass into the [[analyst]] by some kind of [[fantasy|fantastic]] [[introjection|incorporation]].

==Symbolic Identification==
Instead he argues that what is [[introjection|introjected]] is always a [[signifier]].

<blockquote>"Introjection is always the introjection of the speech of the other."<ref>{{S1}} p. 83</ref></blockquote>

[[Introjection]] thus refers to the process of [[symbolic]] [[identification]], the process by which the [[ego-ideal]] is constituted at the end of the [[Oedipus complex]].<ref>{{E}} p. 22</ref>

==Projection==
[[Lacan]] is also opposed to the view that [[introjection]] is the opposite of [[projection]].

Thus whereas in the [[Klein]]ian account an [[object]] can be [[introjection|introjected]] and then [[projection|reprojected]] ''ad infinitum'', [[Lacan]] argues that these two processes are located in entirely different [[register]]s and so cannot be conceived of as part of a single process.

He argues that [[projection]] is an [[imaginary]] phenomenon which relates to [[image]]s, whereas [[introjection]] is a [[symbolic]] process which relates to [[signifier]]s.<ref>{{Ec}} p.655</ref>
