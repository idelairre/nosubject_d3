[http://www.nosubject.com No Subject] is a free online encylopedia for information related to Lacanian psychoanalysis.  It is written collaboratively by an active and growing community of users.

No Subject is an essential reference for students and scholars of Lacan.  It aims to provide a clear and helpful exposition of thousands of (primarily Lacanian) psychoanalytic terms.  Each entry outlines the conceptualization of the idea, locating it within Lacanian discourse, and shows the evolution of the term within the development of Lacan's ideas.  A list of further references is provided at the end of each entry.
