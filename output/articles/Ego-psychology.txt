<!-- [[Ego-psychology]] has been - since its development in the 1930s - the dominant [[school]] of [[psychoanalysis]] in the [[International Psycho-Analytical Association]]. -->
==School==
[[Ego-psychology]] is a [[school]] of [[Sigmund Freud|post-Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]], derived from [[psychology|child psychology]], [[Freud]]'s [[topology|second topography]] and [[Anna Freud]]'s work on the [[ego]] and its [[defence]]s.  It is based on an elaboration of [[Freud]]'s [[structure|structural model]] of the [[mind]], which focuses almost entirely on the function of the [[ego]] in mediating between the conflicting [[demand]]s of the [[instinctual]] [[id]], the [[moralistic]] [[superego]] and [[external]] [[reality]]. 

Ego psychology developed in the United States in the years following the Second World War and focused on ways of strengthening the defence mechanisms of the conscious mind rather than the unconscious motivation of our actions, as in classical psychoanalysis. 

Rudolph Loewenstein, Lacan's training analyst, had been one of the founding fathers of Ego psychology, having fled Nazi persecution in the 1940s. 

==Autonomous Ego==
Founded by European immigrants, this [[school]] of psychoanalysis overemphasized [[adaptation|adjustment]] and [[adaptation]] of the individual to existing social conditions.  In the view of the American analysts the [[ego]] is to be protected, the job of analysis is to reinforce the [[ego]] against the [[demand]]s of the [[instinctual]] [[id]], the [[moralistic]] [[superego]] and [[external]] [[reality]].  [[ego-psychology|Ego-psychologists]], like [[Heinz Hartmann]], [[Ernst Kris]] and [[Rudolph Loewenstein]], asserted that the [[ego]] had an aspect that was not tied up with the individual's [[neurosis|neurotic]] conflicts.  There was a conflict-free zone (the "[[autonomous ego]]"), which seemed free to act and choose, independent of constraints.

==Treatment==
In their view the [[analyst]]'s role was to become an ally of the 'healthy' [[ego]] forces in their struggle to dominate [[instinct]]s and [[drive]]s.  It was said that the [[patient]], in order to strengthen his or her "[[autonomous ego]]", should identify with the [[ego]] of the [[psychoanalyst]].  Hence it was the [[analyst]]'s job to develop a powerful [[ego]].
<!-- [[Heinz Hartmann]]'s ''[[Ego Psychology and the Problem of Adaptation]]'' (1939) is regarded as the foundational text of [[ego-psychology]]. [[Hartmann]] was convinced that the innate elements of a "conflict-free" sphere allow the [[ego]] to function autonomously and independently of mental conflict. According to [[Hartmann]], psychoanalytic treatment aims to expand the conflict-free sphere of ego functioning. By doing so, [[Hartmann]] believed, [[psychoanalysis]] facilitates [[adaptation]], that is, more effective mutual regulation of [[ego]] and [[environment]]. [[Treatment]] tends to be based on the establishment of a therapeutic alliance in which the [[patient]] [[identifies]] with the strong [[ego]] of the [[analyst]]. -->

==History==
[[Ego-psychology]] was taken to the [[United States]] by the Austrian analysts who emigrated there in the late 1930s, and since the early 1950s it has been the dominant school of [[psychoanalysis]] not only in the [[United States]] but also in the whole of the [[IPA]].  This position of dominance has enabled [[ego-psychology]] to present itself as the inheritor of [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]] in its purist form, when in fact there are radical differences between some of its tenets and [[Freud]]'s work.  

For much of his professional life, [[Lacan]] disputed [[ego-psychology]]'s claim to be the true heir to the Freudian legacy, even though [[Lacan]]'s [[analyst]], [[Rudolph Loewenstein]], was one of [[ego-psychology]]'s founding fathers. 
<!-- After [[Lacan]] was expelled from the [[IPA]] in 1953, he was free to voice his criticisms of [[ego-psychology]] openly, and during the rest of his life he developed a sustained and powerful critique. Much of [[Lacan]]ian theory cannot be properly understood without reference to the ideas of [[ego-psychology]] with which [[Lacan]] contrasts it. -->
<!-- His criticisms of [[ego-psychology]] are often intertwined with his criticisms of the [[IPA]] which was dominated by this particular [[school]] of thought.  [[Lacan]] presents both [[ego-psychology]] and the [[IPA]] as the "antithesis" of true psychoanalysis.<ref>{{E}} p.l16</ref>  [[Lacan]] argues that both were irremediably corrupted by the culture of the United States (see [[factor c]]).  [[Lacan]]'s powerful critique has meant that few people now accept uncritically the claims of [[ego-psychology]] to identify itself as "classical psychoanalysis." -->

==Criticism==
[[Lacan]] attacks this position with many arguments.  First, he criticizes the [[ego-psychology|ego-psychologist]]'s concept of a "healthy part" of the [[ego]].  How, asks Lacan, can they know which "part" is "healthy"?  [[Lacan]] challenged all the central concepts of [[ego-psychology]], such as the concepts of [[adaptation]] and the [[autonomous ego]].  Does this not assume that the purpose of [[analysis]] is achieved by an [[identification]] with the [[analyst]]'s [[ego]]?  Is the [[goal]] of [[psychoanalysis]] to bring the [[patient]] to see the world as the [[analyst]] sees it?  [[Lacan]] traces most of [[ego-psychology]]'s problems and contradictions to the idea that there is an "objective", "[[knowledge|knowable]]" [[reality]].

For [[Lacan]], the [[ego]] is the enemy.  The origin of the [[ego]] is in the [[mirror phase]].  The [[mirror]], held by the [[mother]], proffers the developmentally half-formed and muscularly uncontrolled child its first idea of itself as a stable unified appearance.  The [[ego]] is constituted by "alienating [[identification]]s".  [[Lacan]]'s own conception of the [[ego]] suggests that it must be profoundly distrusted because it is unable to discriminate the [[subject]]'s own [[desire]]s from the [[desire]]s of others.
	
According to Lacan, the [[ego]] is not [[autonomous ego|autonomous]], but subordinated and [[alienation|alienated]] to the people and [[image]]s with which it has [[identification|identified]] during its [[development]].  He thought that an [[analysis]] had failed if it ended with the [[analysand]] [[identification|identifying]] with the [[analyst]].  At the conclusion of therapy, what should have disappeared is the armour of the [[ego]], the glass cage of [[narcissistic]] [[illusion]]s.
