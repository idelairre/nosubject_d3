''Edited, with a Foreword and Afterword, by Slavoj Zizek''

The idea of a Lenin renaissance might well provoke an outburst of sarcastic laughter. Marx is OK, but Lenin? Doesn't he stand for the big catastrophe which left its mark on the entire twentieth-century world political scene?

Lenin, however, deserves wider consideration than this, and his writings of 1917 are testament to a formidable political figure. They reveal his ability to grasp the significance of an extraordinary moment in history.

Everything is here, from Lenin-the-ingenious-revolutionary strategist to Lenin-of-the-enactedutopia. To use Kierkegaard's phrase, what we can glimpse in these writings is Lenin-in-becoming: not yet Lenin-the-Soviet-institution, but Lenin thrown into an open, contingent situation. 1917 writings in their historical context, while his Afterword tackles the key question of whether Lenin can be reinvented in our era of 'cultural capitalism,' Zizek is convinced: whatever the discussion…the forthcoming crisis of capitalism, the possibility of a redeeming violence, the falsity of liberal tolerance…he believes that Lenin's time has come again.
