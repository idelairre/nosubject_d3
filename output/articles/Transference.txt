==Sigmund Freud==
===Definition===
The term "[[transference]]" first emerged in [[Freud]]'s work as simply another term for the [[displacement]] of [[affect]] from one idea to another.<ref>{{F}} ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''. 1900a: [[SE]] V, 562</ref>

Later on, however, it came to refer to the [[patient]]'s relationship to the [[analyst]] as it develops in the [[treatment]]. 

This soon became the central meaning of the term, and is the sense in which it is usually understood in [[psychoanalytic theory]] today.

The use of a special term to denote the [[patient]]'s relationship to the [[analyst]] is justified by the peculiar character of this relationship. 

===Treatment===
[[Freud]] was first struck by the intensity of the [[patient]]'s [[affect]]ive reactions to the doctor in Breuer's [[treatment]] of [[Anna O]] in 1882, which he argued was due to the [[patient]] transferring [[unconscious]] ideas onto the doctor.<ref>{{F}} (1895d) With Josef Breuer. ''[[Sigmund Freud|Bibliography|Studies on Hysteria]]''. [[SE]] II.</ref>

====Resistance====
As he developed the psychoanalytic method, [[Freud]] first regarded the [[transference]] exclusively as a [[resistance]] which impedes the recall of [[repression|repressed]] [[memories]], an obstacle to the [[treatment]] which must be "destroyed".<ref>{{F}} (1905e [1901]) "[[Sigmund Freud:Bibliography|Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria]]." [[SE]] VII, 3: 116</ref>

Gradually, however, he modified this view, coming to see the [[transference]] also as a positive factor which helps the [[treatment]] to [[progress]]. 

====Progress====
The positive value of [[transference]] lies in the fact that it provides a way for the [[analysand]]'s history to be confronted in the immediacy of the present relationship with the [[analyst]]; in the way he relates to the [[analyst]], the [[analysand]] inevitably repeats earlier relationships with other figures (especially those with the parents). 

This paradoxical nature of [[transference]], as both an obstacle to the [[treatment]] and that which drives the [[treatment]] forward, perhaps helps to explain why there are so many different and opposing views of [[transference]] in [[psychoanalytic theory]] today.

==Jacques Lacan==
[[Lacan]]'s thinking about [[transference]] goes through several [[development|stages]]. 

===Dialectic===
His first work to deal with the subject in any detail is '''[[Jacques Lacan:Bibliography|An Intervention on the Transference]]'',<ref>{{L}} (1951) "[[Intervention sur le transfert]]." ''[[Écrits]]''. Paris: Seuil, 1966: 215-26 ["[[Intervention sur le transfert|Intervention on the transference]]." Trans. Jacqueline Rose. Eds. Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline Rose. ''Feminine Sexuality: Jacques Lacan and the école freudienne''. London: Macmillan, 1982; New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1982: 61-­73].</ref> in which he describes the [[transference]] in [[dialectic]]al terms borrowed from [[Hegel]]. 

===Affect===
He criticises [[ego-psychology]] for defining the [[transference]] in terms of [[affect]]s:

<blockquote>"Transference does not refer to any mysterious property of affect, and even when it reveals itself under the appearance of emotion, it only acquires meaning by virtue of the dialectical moment in which it is produced."<ref>{{Ec}} p. 225</ref></blockquote>

In other words, [[Lacan]] argues that although [[transference]] often manifests itself in the guise of particularly strong [[affect]]s, such as [[love]] and [[hate]], it does not consist of such emotions but in the [[structure]] of an [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective relationship]]. 

This [[structural]] definition of [[transference]] remains a constant theme throughout the rest of [[Lacan]]'s work; he consistently locates the essence of [[transference]] in the [[symbolic]] and not in the [[imaginary]], although it clearly has powerful imaginary effects.
 
Later on, Lacan will remark that if [[transference]] often manifests itself under the appearance of [[love]], it is first and foremost the [[love]] of [[knowledge]] (''[[savoir]]'') that is concerned.

===Seminar of 1953-54===
[[Lacan]] returns to the subject of the [[transference]] in the [[seminar]] of 1953-4. 

This time he conceives it not in terms borrowed from [[dialectic|Hegelian dialectic]]s but in terms borrowed from the [[anthropology]] of exchange.

[[Transference]] is implicit in the [[speech act]], which involves an exchange of [[sign]]s that transforms the speaker and listener: In its essence, the efficacious [[transference]] which we're considering is quite simply the [[speech]] [[act]]. 

Each time a man speaks to another in an authentic and full manner, there is, in the true sense, [[transference]], [[symbolic]] [[transference]] - something which takes place which changes the nature of the two beings present.<ref>{{S1}} p. 109</ref>

In the [[seminar]] of the following year, he continues to elaborate on the [[symbolic]] nature of [[transference]], which he [[identifies]] with the [[compulsion to repeat]], the [[insistence]] of the symbolic determinants of the [[subject]].<ref>{{S2}} p. 210-11</ref>

This is to be distinguished from the [[imaginary]] aspect of [[transference]], namely, the [[affect]]ive reactions of [[love]] and [[aggressivity]]. 

In this distinction between the [[symbolic]] and [[imaginary]] aspects of [[transference]], [[Lacan]] provides a useful way of understanding the paradoxical function of the [[transference]] in [[psychoanalytic treatment]]; in its symbolic aspect ([[repetition]]) it helps the [[treatment]] [[progress]] by revealing the [[signifiers]] of the subject's [[history]], while in its [[imaginary]] aspect ([[love]] and [[hate]]) it acts as a [[resistance]].<ref>{{S4}} p. 135; {{S8}} p. 204</ref>

[[Lacan]]'s next approach to the subject of [[transference]] is in the eighth year of his [[seminar]],<ref>Lacan, 1960-1</ref> entitled simply "[[The Transference]]". 

Here he uses [[Plato]]'s [[Symposium]] to illustrate the relationship between the [[analysand]] and the [[analyst]]. 

Alcibiades compares Socrates to a plain box which encloses a precious object (Grk ''[[agalma]]''); just as Alcibiades attributes a hidden treasure to Socrates, so the [[analysand]] sees his object of [[desire]] in the [[analyst]] (see [[objet petit a]]).

In 1964, [[Lacan]] articulates the concept of [[transference]] with his concept of the [[subject supposed to know]], which remains central to [[Lacan]]'s view of the [[transference]] from then on; indeed, it is this view of the [[transference]] which has come to be seen as [[Lacan]]'s most complete attempt to theorise the matter.

According to this view, [[transference]] is the attribution of [[knowledge]] to the [[Other]], the supposition that the [[Other]] is a [[subject supposed to know|subject who knows]]:

<blockquote>"As soon as the subject who is supposed to know exists somewhere . . . there is transference."<ref>{{S11}} p. 232</ref></blockquote>

Although the [[existence]] of the [[transference]] is a necessary condition of [[psychoanalytic treatment]], it is not sufficient in itself; it is also necessary that the analyst deal with the [[transference]] in a unique way. 

It is this that differentiates [[psychoanalysis]] from [[suggestion]]; although both are based on the [[transference]], [[psychoanalysis]] differs from [[suggestion]] because the [[analyst]] refuses to use the power given to him by the [[transference]].<ref>{{E}} p. 236</ref>

---

From quite early on in the history of [[psychoanalysis]] it became common to distinguish between those aspects of the [[patient]]'s relationship to the [[analyst]] which were "adapted to reality" and those which were not. 

In the latter category fell all the [[patient]]'s reactions which were caused by "perceiving the analyst in a distorted way". 

Some [[analyst]]s used the term "[[transference]]" to refer to all aspects of the [[analysand]]'s relationship to the [[analyst]], in which case they distinguished the distorted "[[transference|neurotic transference]]" or "[[transference|transference neurosis]]" from the "unobjectionable part of the transference" or "therapeutic alliance."<ref>Edward Bibring, Elizabeth Zeztel</ref>

---

Other analysts argued that the term "[[transference]]" should be restricted to the "unrealistic" or "irrational" reactions of the [[analysand]] (William Silverberg, Franz Alexander). 

However, the common assumption underlying both of these positions was that the [[analyst]] could tell when the [[patient]] was not reacting to him on the basis of who he really was but rather on the basis of previous relationships with other people. 

The [[analyst]] was credited with this ability because he was supposed to be better "adapted to reality" than the [[patient]]. 

Informed by his own correct perception of [[reality]], the [[analyst]] could offer "transference interpretations"; that is, he could point out the discrepancy between the real situation and the irrational way that the [[patient]] was reacting to it. 

It was argued that such [[transference|transference interpretation]]s helped the analysand to gain "insight" into his own [[transference|neurotic transference]] and thereby resolve it or "liquidate" it.

---

Some of [[Lacan]]'s most incisive criticisms are directed at this way of representing [[psychoanalytic treatment]]. 

These criticisms are based on the following arguments:

---

1. The whole idea of [[adaptation]] to [[reality]] is based on a naive empiricist epistemology, involving an appeal to an unproblematic notion of "[[reality]]" as an objective and self-evident given. 

This entirely neglects what [[psychoanalysis]] has discovered about the construction of [[reality]] by the [[ego]] on the basis of its own [[méconnaissance]]. 

Hence when the [[analyst]] assumes that he is better adapted to [[reality]] than the [[patient]] he has no other recourse than "to fall back on his own ego" since this is the only "bit of reality he knows".<ref>{{E}} p. 231</ref> 

The healthy part of the [[patient]]'s [[ego]] is then defmed simply as "the part that thinks as we do".<ref>{{E}} p. 232</ref> 

This reduces [[psychoanalytic treatment]] to a form of [[suggestion]] in which the [[analyst]] simply "imposes his own idea of reality" on the [[analysand]].<ref>{{E}} p. 232</ref> 

<blockquote> Thus "the inability [of the analyst] to sustain a praxis in an authentic  manner results, as is usually the case with mankind, in the exercise of power."<ref>{{E}} p. 226</ref></blockquote>

---

2. The idea that the [[analysand]]'s "distorted perception of the analyst" could be liquidated by means of [[interpretation]]s is a logical fallacy, since the [[transference]] is [[interpretation|interpreted]] on the basis of, and with the instrument of, the [[transference]] itself.<ref>{{S8}} p. 206</ref> 

In other words, there is no [[metalanguage]] of the [[transference]], no vantage point outside the [[transference]] from which the [[analyst]] could offer an [[interpretation]], since any [[interpretation]] he offers "will be received as coming from the person that the transference imputes him to be."<ref>{{E}} p. 231</ref>

---

Thus it is contradictory to claim that the [[transference]] can be dissolved by means of an [[interpretation]] when it is the [[transference]] itself which conditions the [[analysand]]'s acceptance of that [[interpretation]]:

<blockquote>"The emergence of the subject from the transference is thus postponed ad infinitum."<ref>{{E}} p. 231</ref></blockquote>

---

Does this mean that [[Lacanian]] [[analyst]]s never interpret the [[transference]]? 

Certainly not; [[Lacan]] affirms that "it is natural to interpret the transference,"<ref>{{E}} p. 271</ref> but at the same time he harbours no [[illusion]]s about the power of such [[interpretation]]s to dissolve the [[transference]]. 

Like any other [[interpretation]], the [[analyst]] must use all his [[art]] in deciding if and when to [[interpret]] the [[transference]], and above all must avoid gearing his [[interpretation]]s exclusively to [[interpreting]] the [[transference]]. 

He must also know exactly what he is seeking to achieve by such an [[interpretation]]; not to rectify the [[patient]]'s relationship to [[reality]], but to maintain the [[discourse|analytic dialogue]]. 

<blockquote>"What does it mean, to interpret the transference? Nothing else than to fill the void of this deadlock with a lure. But while it may be deceptive, this lure serves a purpose by setting off the whole process again."<ref>{{Ec}} p. 225</ref></blockquote>

---

When describing the [[transference]] as "positive" or "negative", [[Lacan]] takes two different approaches. 

Following [[Freud]], [[Lacan]] sometimes uses these adjectives to refer to the nature of the [[affect]]s, "[[transference|positive transference]]" referring to loving affects and "[[transference|negative transference]]" referring to [[aggressivity|aggressive]] [[affect]]s.<ref>{{Ec}} p. 222</ref>

---

Sometimes, however, [[Lacan]] takes the terms "positive" and "negative" to refer to the favourable or unfavourable effects of the [[transference]] on the [[treatment]]<ref>{{E}} 271</ref> (where [[Lacan]] argues that when the [[analysand]]'s [[resistance]] opposes [[suggestion]], this [[resistance]] must be "placed in the ranks of the positive transference" on the grounds that it maintains the direction of the [[analysis]]).

---

Although [[Lacan]] does speak occasionally of [[countertransference]], he generally prefers not to use this term.
