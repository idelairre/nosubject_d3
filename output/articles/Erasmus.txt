Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus (also Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam) (October 27, probably 1466 â€“ July 12, 1536) was a Dutch humanist and theologian. Erasmus was a classical scholar who wrote in a "pure" Latin style.

Erasmus was influential on Martin Luther who admired him and desired his friendship.

Although Erasmus remained a Roman Catholic throughout his lifetime, he harshly criticised what he considered excesses of the Roman Catholic Church and even turned down a Cardinalship when it was offered to him.

In his Treatise on Preparation For Death he made clear his position, that faith in the atonement of Christ, and not in the sacraments and rituals of the church, are the only guarantee of eternal life.

He prepared new Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament. Erasmus wrote The Praise of Folly, Handbook of a Christian Knight, and On Civility in Children.
