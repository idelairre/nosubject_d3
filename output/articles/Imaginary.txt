In the [[Jacques Lacan:Bibliography|work]] of [[Jacques Lacan]], the [[real]], the [[symbolic]], and the [[imaginary]] are a central [[order|set of references]]. The [[imaginary]] is the [[order|field]] of the [[ego]].
-->
<!--
=====History=====
[[Lacan]]'s use of the term "[[imaginary]]" as a substantive dates back to [[{{Y}}|1936]].<ref>{{Ec}} p. 81</ref>  The term relates to the [[dual relation]] between the [[ego]] and the [[specular image]].  From [[{{Y}}|1953]] on, the [[imaginary]] becomes one of the [[order|three orders]] which constitute the [[order|tripartite scheme]] at the center of [[Lacan]]ian thought, being opposed to the [[symbolic]] and the [[real]]. 
-->
<!--
It took Lacan twenty years to restore the imaginary to its full place alongside the real and the symbolic, which he did within the topic of the Borromean knot (a set of three interlinked rings that come apart if any one is removed).
-->
<!-- In his 1936 essay "Au-delà du 'principe de réalité"' (Beyond the reality principle), Lacan noted that Freud discovered a meaning in patients' complaints that other physicians considered imaginary and thus illusory. In his first reading of Freud's work, Lacan emphasized the notion of the image by highlighting its function: reflecting the subject's discrete behaviors in unified images. In the mirror stage, the subject identifies with these images and develops an ego concept in relation to another. -->
=====Ego=====
The [[imaginary|imaginary order]] is based on the [[formation]] of the [[ego]] in the [[mirror stage]] by [[identification]] with the [[counterpart]] (or [[specular image]]).  The [[dual relation]] between the [[ego]] and the [[counterpart]] is characterized by [[alienation]] and [[narcissism]].
<!-- 
The [[imaginary|imaginary order]] is based on the [[mirror stage]], whereby the [[ego]] is constituted by [[identification]] with the [[other|little other]]. The [[ego]] is [[formation|formed]] by [[identification|identifying]] with the [[counterpart]] or [[specular image]]. Thus, [[identification]] is an important aspect of the [[imaginary|imaginary order]]. The [[ego]] and the [[counterpart]] form the prototypical [[dual relation]]ship, and are interchangeable.  
identification is essential to the structure of the imaginary order and to the development of the human ego.</i> The basis of the [[imaginary|imaginary order]] is the [[mirror stage]], in which the [[subject]] [[identification|identifies]] with its [[counterpart]] or [[specular image] and develops an ego concept in relation to another. 
((Since the [[ego]] is formed by [[identifying]] with the [[counterpart]] or [[specular image]], [[identification]] is an important aspect of the [[imaginary|imaginary order]]. ))
-->
<!--
This relation­ship whereby the [[ego]] is constituted by [[identification]] with the [[other|little other]] means that the [[ego]], and the [[imaginary|imaginary order]] itself, are both sites of a radical [[alienation]]; "Alienation is constitutive of the imaginary order."<ref>{{S3}} p. 146</ref>  
The [[dual relation]]ship between the [[ego]] and the [[counterpart]] is fundamentally [[narcissistic]], and [[narcissism]] is another characteristic of the [[imaginary|imaginary order]]. [[Narcissism]] is always accompanied by a certain [[aggressivity]].
-->

=====Image=====
The [[imaginary]] is the realm of [[image]] and [[imagination]], [[truth|deception]] and [[lure]]. The principal illusions of the [[imaginary]] are those of [[gestalt|wholeness]], [[dialectic|synthesis]], [[autonomous ego|autonomy]], [[dual relation|duality]] and, above all, [[counterpart|similarity]]. 
<!-- 
The [[imaginary]] exerts a [[captation|captivating power]] over the [[subject]], founded in the almost hypnotic effect of the [[specular image]].  The [[imaginary]] is thus rooted in [[subject]]'s relationship to his own body (or rather to the [[image]] of his body). This [[captation|captivating/capturing power]] is both [[seductive]] (the [[imaginary]] is manifest­ed above all on the sexual plane, in such forms as sexual display and courtship rituals)<ref>{{L}} "[[Situation de la psychanalyse et formation du psychanalyste en 1956]]." ''[[Écrits]]''. Paris: Seuil, 1966 [1956b]: 272</ref> and disabling: it imprisons the [[subject]] in series of static fixations.
-->

=====Psychology=====
The [[imaginary]] is the dimension of the [[human]] [[subject]] which is most closely linked to [[animal]] [[psychology]], yet it is [[structure]]d by the [[symbolic]], and this means that "in man, the imaginary relation has deviated [from the realm of nature]."<ref>{{S2}} p. 210</ref>
<!--
the [[imaginary]] represents the closest point of contact between [[human]] [[subjectivity]] and [[animal]] [[ethology]],<ref>{{S2}} p. 166</ref> it is not simply identical; the [[imaginary|imaginary order]] in [[human]] [[being]]s is [[structure]]d by the [[symbolic]], and this means that "in man, the imaginary relation has deviated [from the realm of nature]."<ref>{{S2}} p. 210</ref>
All attempts to explain [[human]] [[subjectivity]] in terms of [[animal]] [[psychology]] are thus limited to the [[imaginary]].  Although the [[imaginary]] represents the closest point of contact between [[human]] [[subjectivity]] and [[animal]] [[ethology]],<ref>{{S2}} p. 166</ref> it is not simply identical; the [[imaginary|imaginary order]] in [[human]] [[being]]s is [[structure]]d by the [[symbolic]], and this means that "in man, the imaginary relation has deviated [from the realm of nature]."<ref>{{S2}} p. 210</ref>
-->

=====Criticism=====
[[Lacan]] accused the major [[school|psychoanalytic schools]] of reducing [[psychoanalysis]] to the [[imaginary|imaginary order]].
<!--
[[Lacan]] accused the major [[school|psychoanalytic schools]] of his day of reducing [[psychoanalysis]] to the [[imaginary|imaginary order]]: these psychoanalysts made [[identification]] with the [[analyst]] into the goal of [[treatment|analysis]], and reduced [[treatment|analysis]] to a [[dual relation]]ship.<ref>{{E}} p. 246-7</ref> [[Lacan]] sees this as a complete betrayal of [[psychoanalysis]], a deviation which can only eveer succeed in increasing the [[alienation]] of the [[subject]].
