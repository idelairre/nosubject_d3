Derived from the Latin words ''solus'' ('only') and ''ipse'' ('self'), the term is sometimes used as a synonym for 'selfishness' or 'egotism'.

In philosophy it is used more strictly to describe the thesis that only the self exists.

All philosophies that, like the Cartesian ''[[cogito]]'' ('I am thinking, therefore I am')<ref>1637</ref>, take as their starting-point the immediate experience of an individual [[consciousness]] tends to lapse into [[solipsism]] as they have difficulty in establishing the existence of other [[consciousness]]es.

Both [[Husserl]]'s pure [[phenomenology]] and the [[existentialism]] of the early [[Sartre]] have been criticized for their alleged [[solipsism]].
