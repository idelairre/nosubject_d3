On April 8, Charles R. Douglass, the inventor of [[canned laughter]] — the artificial jollity that accompanies comical moments on [[TV]] shows — died at 93 in Templeton, California.  In the early ’50s, he developed the idea to enhance or substitute live audience reaction on [[television]].  This idea was realized in the guise of a keyboard machine; by pressing on different keys, it was possible to produce different kinds of laughter.  First used for episodes of <i>The Jack Benny Show</i> and <i>I Love Lucy,</i> today its modernized version is present everywhere.

The overwhelming presence of [[canned laughter]] makes us blind to its core [[paradox]], even as it undermines our natural presuppositions about the state of our innermost [[emotion]]s.  [[Canned laughter]] marks a true “[[return of the repressed]],” an attitude we usually attribute to “[[primitives]].”  Recall, in traditional societies, the weird phenomenon of “weepers,” women hired to cry at funerals.  A rich man can hire them to cry and mourn on his behalf while he attends to a more lucrative business (like negotiating for the fortune of the deceased).  This role can be played not only by another [[human being]], but by a machine, as in the case of [[Tibet]]an [[prayer wheel]]s: I put a written prayer into a wheel and mechanically turn it (or, even better, link the wheel to a mill that turns it).  It prays for me — or, more precisely, I “[[objective]]ly” pray through it, while my mind can be occupied with the dirtiest of [[sexual]] thoughts.

Douglass’ invention proved that the same “[[primitive]]” [[mechanism]] works also in highly developed societies.  When I come home in the evening too exhausted to engage in meaningful activity, I just tune in to a [[TV]] sitcom; even if I do not laugh, but simply stare at the [[screen]], tired after a hard day’s work, I nonetheless feel relieved after the show.  It is as if the TV were literally laughing in my place, instead of me.

Yet before one gets used to [[canned laughter]], there is nonetheless usually a brief period of uneasiness.  The first reaction is of mild shock, since it is difficult to accept that the machine out there can “laugh for me.”  Even if the program was “taped in front of a live studio audience,” this audience manifestly did not include me, and now exists only in mediated form as part of the TV show itself.  However, with time, one grows accustomed to this disembodied laughter, and the phenomenon is experienced as “[[natural]].”  This is what is so unsettling about [[canned laughter]]: My most [[intimate]] feelings can be radically externalized.  I can literally laugh and cry through another. 

This logic holds not only for [[emotion]]s, but also for [[belief]]s.  According to a well-known [[anthropological]] anecdote, the “[[primitives]]” to whom one attributes certain “[[superstitious]] [[beliefs]],” that they descend from a fish or from a bird, for example, when directly asked about these [[belief]]s, answer, “Of course not — we’re not that stupid!  But I was told that our ancestors did believe that.”  In short, they transfer their [[belief]] onto another.  Are we not doing the same with our children?  We go through the ritual of [[Santa Claus]], since our children (are supposed to) believe in it, and we do not want to disappoint them; they pretend to believe not to disappoint us and our belief in their naiveté (and to get the presents, of course).

In an [[uncanny]] way, some [[belief]]s always seem to function “at a [[distance]].”  For the [[belief]] to function, there has to be some ultimate [[guarantor]] of it, yet this guarantor is always [[deferred]], [[displaced]], never [[present]] in person.  The [[subject]] who <i>directly</i> believes need not exist for the [[belief]] to be operative: It is enough merely to presuppose its existence in the guise of, say, a [[mythological]] [[founding figure]] who is not part of our [[reality]].

———————<br><br>

Against this background, one is tempted to [[supplement]] the fashionable notion of “[[interactivity]]” with its shadowy and much more [[uncanny]] [[double]], “[[interpassivity]]” (a term invented by Robert Pfaller).  Today, it is a commonplace to emphasize how, with new electronic media, the passive consumption of a text or a work of [[art]] is over: I no longer merely stare at the [[screen]], I increasingly interact with it, entering into a dialogic relationship with it, from choosing the programs, through participating in debates in a [[virtual]] [[community]], to directly determining the outcome of the plot in so-called “interactive narratives.”

Those who praise the [[democratic]] potential of such new [[media]] generally focus on precisely these features.  But there is another side of my “[[interaction]],” which the [[object]] of interaction itself deprives me of: my own [[passive]] reaction of [[satisfaction]] (or [[mourning]] or [[laughter]]).  The [[object]] itself “enjoys the show” instead of me, relieving me of the need to enjoy myself.  Do we not [[witness]] “[[interpassivity]]” in a great number of today’s [[public]]ity spots or posters that, as it were, passively enjoy the product instead of us?  [[Coca-Cola]] cans bearing the inscription, “Ooh! Ooh! What taste!” emulate in advance the ideal customer’s reaction.

When a man tells a tasteless bad [[joke]] and then, when nobody around him laughs, he bursts out into a noisy, nervous laughter, he has found himself obliged to act out the expected reaction of the [[public]] for them.  This supplied laughter is similar to the [[canned laughter]] of the [[TV]] set, but in this example, the agent that laughs instead of us (i.e., through which we, the bored and embarrassed [[public]], laugh) is not an anonymous audio track claiming to laugh for an invisible [[public]] — the “[[Big Other]]” — but the narrator of the joke himself.  He does this in order to ensure the inscription of his act into the “[[Big Other]],” the [[symbolic]] [[order]] of all those around him.  His [[compulsive]] laughter is much like how we feel obliged to utter “Oops!” when we stumble or do something stupid.  If we do not say “Oops!” — if we do not inscribe our acknowledgement of the error onto the [[public]] [[order]] — it is as if, by allowing an [[imaginary]] dialogue between ourselves and the “[[Big Other]]” to remain incomplete, we commit ourselves to [[symbolic]] oblivion.

VCR aficionados who [[compulsively]] record hundreds of movies (myself among them) are well aware that the immediate effect of owning a VCR is that one effectively watches less [[film]]s than in the good old days of a simple [[TV]] set without a VCR.  One never has time for TV, so, instead of losing a precious evening, one simply tapes the [[film]] and stores it for a future viewing (for which, of course, there is almost never time).  So, although I do not actually watch films, the very awareness that the films I love are stored in my video library gives me a profound [[satisfaction]] and, occasionally, enables me to simply relax and indulge in the exquisite art of doing nothing — as if the VCR is, in a way, watching and enjoying them for me, in my place.

In the [[interpassive]] arrangement, I am passive through the [[Other]]; I accede to the [[Other]] the passive aspect (of enjoying), while I can remain actively engaged — that is, I can work longer hours with less need for “nonproductive” activity, such as leisure or [[mourning]].  I can continue to work in the evening, while the VCR passively enjoys for me; I can make financial arrangements for the deceased’s fortune while the weepers mourn in my place.

One should therefore turn around one of the commonplaces of [[conservative]] [[cultural criticism]]: In contrast to the notion that new [[media]] turn us into [[passive]] [[consumer]]s who just stare numbly at the [[screen]], the real [[threat]] of new [[media]] is that they deprive us of our [[passivity]], of our authentic passive experience, and thus prepare us for mindless frenetic activity — for endless work.

So then, would it not be a proper funeral for Charles R. Douglass if a set of sound-machines were to accompany his coffin, generating whispered laments, while his beloved surviving relatives enjoyed a hearty meal, or perhaps got some work done elsewhere?  Far from finding it offensive, I think perhaps he would appreciate the recognition of such a burial.
