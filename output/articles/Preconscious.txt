==Freudian Dictionary==
<blockquote>Everything unconscious that can easily exchange the unconscious condition for the conscious one, is better described as "capable of entering consciousness," or as ''preconscious''.<ref>{{OoPA}} Ch. 4</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>From a purely descriptive point of view, the "preconscious" is also unconscious, but we do not give it that name, except when we are speaking loosely, or when we have to defend in general the existence of unconscious processes in mental life.<ref>{{NILP}} Ch. 3</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>That which is latent, and only unconscious in the. descriptive and not in the dynamic sense, we call ''preconscious''; the term unconscious we reserve for the dynamically unconscious repressed, so that we now have three terms, conscious (Cs), preconscious (Pcs), and unconscious (Ucs), which are no longer purely descriptive in sense.<ref>{{E&I}} Ch. 1</ref></blockquote>
