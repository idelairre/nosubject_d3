Etymologically, the word [[rival]] refers to people who live by the river and draw their water from the same stream. 

From a [[psychoanalytic]] point of view, [[rivalry]] is not simply a struggle for possession of the [[object]], but can also be understood as having [[sexual]], [[identificatory]], and [[narcissistic]] aspects.

The ensemble of [[partial drive]]s directed toward the [[mother]], once she is perceived as an [[object]] that is differentiated from the [[self]], is accompanied by hostile [[rivalry]] toward the [[father]]. 
This [[oedipal]] [[rivalry]] is extended to the hostile relationships that occur among siblings.

The [[object]] of [[rivalry]] can change in relation to [[bisexuality]]. 
[[Wish]]es for the rival's [[death]] are [[repressed]], and the formerly [[hated]] [[rival]] becomes a [[homosexual]] [[love]]-[[object]]. 

In "[[Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia and Homosexuality]]", [[Sigmund Freud]] posited an analogy between this mechanism and the process that is the basis for [[social]] [[bond]]s: 
"In both processes, there is first the presence of jealous and hostile impulses which cannot achieve satisfaction; and both the affectionate and the social feelings of identification arise as reactive formations against the repressed aggressive impulses."<ref>"[[Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia and Homosexuality]]". p. 232</ref>

[[Freud]] thus attributed the decline of [[rivalry]] to [[repression]], which results from the establishing of the [[superego]] and from the confrontation between hostile [[wish]]es and the [[child]]'s [[impotence]].

[[Rivalry]] creates a link of [[ambivalence]] between the [[subject]] and an [[other]] who can always become the [[subject]]'s alter [[ego]], because the [[object]] of [[desire]] is the same for both. 

Putting himself in the place of this [[other]], the [[subject]] imagines himself as being dispossessed of a source of [[enjoyment]] (''[[jouissance]]'') that tolerates no sharing. 
The [[subject]]'s hatred is all the stronger because [[unconscious]]ly, this struggle is for possession of an [[object]] that bears the [[narcissistic]] [[illusion]] of perfect continuity between [[self]] and [[other]]. 
The destructiveness of the tendency away from differentiation is thus transformed into hatred and suspended through triangulation.

[[Rivalry]], which tends toward [[repetition]] and acquires its various layers through reaction formations, is one component in the structuring of [[human]] [[desire]].
