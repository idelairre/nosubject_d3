==Drive and Instinct==
===Sigmund Freud===
[[Freud]]'s concept of the [[drive]] is central to his theory of [[human]] [[sexuality]]; it lies at the heart of his theory of [[sexuality]].

For [[Freud]], the distinctive feature of [[human]] [[sexuality]] -- as opposed to the sexual life of other animals -- is that it is not regulated by any [[instinct]] -- a concept which implies a relatively fixed and innate relationship to an [[object]] -- but by the [[drive]]s -- which differ from [[instinct]]s in that they are extremely variable, and develop in ways which are contingent on the life history of the [[subject]].

===Jacques Lacan===
[[Lacan]] insists on maintaining the [[Freud]]ian distinction between [[drive]] and [[instinct]].<ref>{{E}} p.301</ref>

Whereas [[instinct]] denotes a mythical [[linguistic|pre-linguistic]] [[need]], the [[drive]] is completely removed from the realm of [[biology]].

====Aim of the Drive====
The [[drive]]s differ from [[biological]] [[need]]s in that they can never be [[satisfied]], and do not aim at an [[object]] but rather circle perpetually round it.

[[Lacan]] argues that the purpose of the [[drive]] (''[[Triebziel]]'') is not to reach a ''goal'' (a final destination) but to follow its ''aim'' (the way itself), which is to circle round the [[object]].<ref>{{S11}} p.168</ref>

Thus the real purpose of the [[drive]] is not some mythical goal of full [[satisfaction]], but to return to its circular path, and the real source of [[enjoyment]] is the [[repetition|repetitive movement]] of this closed circuit.

====Drive as Cultural and Symbolic Construct====
[[Lacan]] reminds his readers that [[Freud]] defined the [[drive]] as a montage composed of four discontinuous elements: the pressure, the end, the object and the source.

The [[drive]] cannot therefore be conceived of as "some ultimate given, something archaic, primordial."<ref>{{S11}} p.162</ref>

It is a thoroughly [[culture|cultural]] and [[symbolic]] construct.

[[Lacan]] thus empties the concept of the [[drive]] of the lingering references in [[Freud]]'s work to energetics and hydraulics.


==The Circuit of the Drive==
[[Lacan]] incorporates the four elements of the [[drive]] in his theory of the [[drive]]'s circuit.

In this circut, the [[drive]] originates in an [[erogenous zone]].

This circuit is structured by the three grammatical voices.

# The active voice (e.g. to see)

# The reflexive voice (e.g. to see oneself)

# The passive voice (e.g. to be seen)

===Activity and Passivity===
The first of these two times (active and reflexive voices) are autoerotic; they lack a [[subject]]. 

Only in the third time (the passive voice), when the [[drive]] completes its circuit, does "a new subject" appear (which is to say that before this time, there was no subject).

Although the third time is the passive voice, the [[drive]] is always essentially active, which is why [[Lacan]] writes that the third time not as "to be seen" but as "to make oneself be seen."

Even supposedly "passive" phases of the [[drive]] such as [[masochism]] involve [[activity]].<ref>{{S11}} p.200</ref>

The circuit of the [[drive]] is the only way for the [[subject]] to transgress the [[pleasure principle]].


==The Partial Nature of the Drives==
[[Freud]] argued that [[sexuality]] is composed of a number of [[drive|partial drives]] ([[Ger]]. ''[[drive|Partieltrieb]]'') such as the [[drive|oral drive]] and the [[drive|anal drive]], each specified by a different source (a different erotogenic zone).

At first these component [[drive]]s function anarchically and independently (viz. the "polymorphous perversity" of children), but in puberty they become organized and fused together under the priamcy of the genital organs.<ref>{{F}} p.1905d.</ref>

===Differences between Freud and Lacan===
[[Lacan]] emphasizes the partial nature of all [[drive]]s, but differs from [[Freud]] on two points:

# [[Lacan]] rejects the idea that the partial drives can ever attain any complete organization or fusion, aruging that the priamcy of the genital zone, if achieved, is always a highly precarious affair.

: He thus challenges the notion, put forward by some psychoanalysts after [[Freud]], of a genital drive in which the partial drives are completely integrated in a harmonious relation.

# [[Lacan]] argues that the [[drive]]s are partial, not in the sense that thy are parts of a whole (a 'genital drive'), but in the sense that they only represent sexuality partially; they do not represent the reproductive function of sexuality but only the dimension of enjoyment.<ref>{{S11}} p.204</ref>


===The Four Partial Drives===
[[Lacan]] identifies four partial drives: the [[drive|oral drive]], the [[drive|anal drive]], the [[drive|scopic drive]], and the [[drive|invocatory drive]].

Each of these [[drive]]s is specified by a different [[partial object]] and a different [[erogenous zone]].

The first two [[drive]]s relate to [[demand]], whereas the second pair relate to [[desire]].

==The Lacanian Matheme for the Drive==
In 1957, in the context of the [[graph of desire]], [[Lacan]] proposes the formula ('''S <> D''') as the [[matheme]] for the [[drive]].

This formula is to be read: the [[bar]]ed [[subject]] in relation to [[demand]], the fading of the [[subject]] before the insistence of a [[demand]] that persists without any [[conscious]] [[intention]] to sustain it.


==The Dualism of the Drives==
===Sigmund Freud: Life and Death===
Throughout the various reformulations of drive-theory in [[Freud]]'s work, one constant feature is a basic dualism.

At first this dualism was conceived in terms of an opposition between the [[drive|sexual drive]]s (''[[drive|Sexualtriebe]]'') on the one hand, and the [[drive|ego-drive]]s (''[[drive|Ichtriebe]]'') or [[drive|drives of self-preservation]] (''[[drive|Selbsterhaltungstriebe]]'') on the other.

This opposition was problematized by [[Freud]]'s growing realization, in the period 1914-20, that the [[drive|ego-drive]]s are themselves sexual.

He was thus led to reconceptualize the dualism of the [[drive]]s in terms of an opposition between the [[drive|life drive]]s (''[[drive|Lebenstriebe]]'') and the [[death drive]]s (''[[death drive|Todestriebe]]'').

===Jacques Lacan: Symbolic and Imaginary===
[[Lacan]] argues that it is important to retain [[Freud]]'s dualism, and rejects the monism of [[Jung]], who argued that all psychic forces could be reduced to one single concept of psychic energy.<ref>{{S1}} p.118-20</ref>

However, [[Lacan]] prefers to reconceptualize this dualism in terms of an opposition between the [[symbolic]] and the [[imaginary]], and not in terms of an opposition between different kinds of [[drive]]s.

Thus, for [[Lacan]], all [[drive]]s are [[drive|sexual drive]]s, and every [[drive]] is a [[death drive]] since every [[drive]] is excessive, [[repetition|repetitive]], and ultimately destructive.<ref>{{Ec}} p.848</ref>

==Drive and Desire==
The [[drive]]s are closely related to [[desire]]; both originate in the field of the [[subject]], as opposed to the [[drive|genital drive]], which (if it exists) finds its form on the side of the [[Other]].<ref>{{S11}} p.189</ref>

However, the [[drive]] is not merely another name for [[desire]]: they are the partial aspects in which [[desire]] is realized.

[[Desire]] is one and undivided, whereas the [[drive]]s are partial manifestations of [[desire]].
