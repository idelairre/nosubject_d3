'''Christian Metz''' is a [[France|French]] [[film critic]], best known for the application of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s theories of [[Semiotics]] to [[film]].

His most well-known contribution to [[film criticism]] lies in applying both [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychology]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]'s [[Jacques_Lacan#The_mirror_stage_.28le_stade_du_miroir.29|mirror theory]] to the cinema, proposing that the reason film is popular as an art form lies in its ability to both be an imperfect reflection of reality and as a method to delve into the unconscious dream state.
