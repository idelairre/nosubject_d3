The following is from Cornell University Graduate School website.[http://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/index.php?p=5]

==Application form==
Inform the graduate field if the name on any credential will be different from that on your application. Application can be made only to major (not minor) fields.

==Statement of purpose==
A one- or two-page statement stating your reasons for undertaking graduate work, as well as an explanation of your academic interests, including their relation to your undergraduate study and professional goals. Include your full name and your proposed field of study at the top of each page.

==Transcripts==
Submit official, complete transcripts from each college or university previously attended to the field to which you are applying. If it is against an institution's policy to send transcripts to the applicant, the transcripts can be mailed by the school directly to the field to which you are applying. 

==Recommendations==
Two or three letters of recommendation (depending on the field) must be submitted from faculty members acquainted with your work. If that work occurred some time ago, check with the field to see whether recommendations from those familiar with your professional performance might be acceptable.

Under federal legislation, once enrolled, students have access to their letters of recommendation. If you request, such right of access can be waived by checking the appropriate box on the online application. 

==Application fee==
 A nonrefundable application fee of $70 must be submitted with the application. Payment must be by: 1) an e-check in U.S. dollars drawn on a U.S. bank, 2) a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover credit card.
