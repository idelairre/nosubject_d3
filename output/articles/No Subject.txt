Welcome to [[No Subject]], a free online encylopedia for information related to [[Lacan]]ian [[psychoanalysis]].

It is written collaboratively by an active and growing community of users.

The information is organized in the form of a hypertext, a cross-referential database with non-linear navigational structure.

This "prevalence of the text ... makes possible the kind of tightening up" that for [[Jacques Lacan]] "leaves the reader ''no other way out than the way in''."<ref>{{L}} [[The Agency of the Letter in the Unconscious or Reason Since Freud]]. 1977, p. 146</ref> 

[[No Subject]] is concerned only with providing this "way in".

Please visit the [[No Subject:Community Portal|Community Portal]] to get involved or the [[Help:Contents|help page]] to learn more about the site.  Feel free to ask questions in the [[Special:Forum|forum]].
