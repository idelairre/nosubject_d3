==Intellect==
===Sigmund Freud===
In [[Freud]]'s work, the term "[[affect]]" stands in opposition to the term "[[idea]]". The opposition between the [[affect|affective]] and the [[affect|intellectual]] is one of the oldest themes in [[philosophy]], and made its way into [[Freud]]'s vocabulary via [[German]] [[psychology]].

===Jacques Lacan===
For [[Lacan]], however, the opposition between the [[affective]] and the [[intellectual]] is not valid in the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic field]]. 

<blockquote>"This opposition is one of the most contrary to analytic experience and most unenlightening when it comes to understanding it."<ref>{{S1}} p.274</ref></blockquote>

Thus, in response to those who accuse [[Lacan]] of being [[affect|over-intellectual]] and of neglecting the role of [[affect]], it can be pointed out that this criticism is based on what [[Lacan]] saw as a false opposition.<ref>[[Lacan]] also argued that criticisms of being over-intellectual were often merely excuses for sloppy thinking. {{E}} p.171</ref>

====Treatment====
[[Psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]] is based on the [[symbolic]] [[order]], which transcends the opposition between [[affect]] and [[affect|intellect]].  On the one hand, [[psychoanalytic]] experience "is not that of an affective smoochy-woochy."<ref>{{S1}} p.55</ref>  On the other hand, nor is [[psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]] an intellectual affair.

<blockquote>"We are not dealing here with an intellectual dimension."<ref>{{S1}} p.274</ref></blockquote> 

====Resistance====
The [[Lacan]]ian [[psychoanalyst]] must thus be aware of the ways in which both "affective smoochy-woochy" and intellectualisation can be [[resistance]]s to [[analysis]], [[imaginary]] [[lure]]s of the [[ego]].  [[Anxiety]] is the only [[affect]] that is not [[truth|deceptive]].

====Separate====
[[Lacan]] is opposed to those [[analyst]]s who have taken the [[affect]]ive realm as primary, for the [[affect]]ive is not a separate realm opposed to the [[intellectual]].

<blockquote>"The affective is not like a special density which would escape an intellectual accounting. It is not to be found in a mythical beyond of the production of the symbol which would precede the discursive formulation."<ref>{{S1}} p.57</ref></blockquote>

However, he rejects accusations of neglecting the role of [[affect]], pointing to the fact that a whole year of the [[seminar]] is dedicated precisely to discussing [[anxiety]].<ref>{{TV}} p. 38</ref>

==Treatment==
===Symbolic===
[[Lacan]] does not propose a general theory of [[affect]]s, but only touches on them insofar as they impinge on [[psychoanalytic treatment]].  He insists on the relationship of [[affect]] to the [[symbolic]] [[order]]; [[affect]] means that the [[subject]] is affected by his relation with the [[Other]].  He argues that [[affect]]s are not [[signifier]]s but [[signal]]s,<ref>{{S7}} p. 102-3</ref> and emphasizes [[Freud]]'s position that [[repression]] does not bear upon the [[affect]] (which can only be transformed or [[displacement|displaced]]) but upon the ideational representative (which is, in [[Lacan]]'s terms, the [[signifier]]).<ref>{{Ec}} p. 714</ref>

===Practice===
[[Lacan]]'s comments on the concept of [[affect]] have important implications in [[clinical]] [[practice]]. 

=====Structure=====
Firstly, all the [[:Category:Concepts|concept]]s in [[psychoanalysis]] which have traditionally been conceived in terms of [[affect]]s, such as the [[transference]], must be rethought in terms of their [[symbolic]] [[structure]], if the [[analyst]] is to direct the [[treatment]] correctly.

=====Lure=====
Secondly, the [[affect]]s are [[lure]]s which can deceive the [[analyst]], and hence the [[analyst]] must be wary of being tricked by his own [[affect]]s.  This does not mean that the [[analyst]] must disregard his own feelings for the [[patient]], but simply that he must know how to make adequate use of them.

=====Truth=====
Finally, it follows that the aim of [[psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]] is not the reliving of [[past]] experiences, nor the [[abreaction]] of [[affect]], but the articulation in [[speech]] of the [[truth]] about [[desire]].

====Passion====
Another term in [[Lacan]]'s [[discourse]], related to but distinct from "[[affect]]," is the term "[[passion]]."  [[Lacan]] speaks of the "three fundamental passions": [[love]], [[hate]] and [[ignorance]].<ref>{{S1}} p. 271</ref>  This is a reference to Buddhist thought.<ref>{{E}} p. 94</ref> These [[passion]]s are not [[imaginary|imaginary phenomena]], but located at the junctions between the [[order|three order]]s.
