The Lacanian Subject is, therefore, constituted through two movements: the first corresponds to the process of alienaiton through language, the second to the separation of desire.

Lacan never, however, precisely designates the poitn at whcih the subject appears, because it never appears as such.

The subject in Lacanian psychoanalysis has no permanence or persistence.

Lacan always refers to the subject as arriving or having just arrived; as always too early or too late.


There is never the poitn in tiem that the subject can be said to finally emerge as a stable and complete entityt.

It emerges only fleetingly through a continuous process of subjectification -alienation and separation - rather than at a specific moment in time.
