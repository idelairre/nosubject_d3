==Sigmund Freud==
===Sexual Difference===
[[Freud]] first described the [[castration complex]] in 1908, arguing that the [[child]] - on discovering the [[biology|anatomical]] [[sexual difference|difference between the sexes]] -- the [[presence]] or [[absence]] of the [[penis]] - makes the assumption that this [[sexual difference|difference]] is due to the [[female]]'s [[penis]] having been cut off.<ref>{{F}} "[[Works of Sigmund Freud|On the Sexual Theories of Children]]". 1908. [[SE]] IX. p. 207</ref> In his view, the [[castration complex]] is the moment when one "[[castration complex|infantile theory]]" -- that every [[human]] [[being]] has a [[penis]] -- is replaced by a new one -- that [[female]]s have been [[castrated]]. The consequences of this new [[castration complex|infantile theory]] are different in the [[boy]] and in the [[girl]]. The [[boy]] fears that his own [[penis]] will be cut off by the [[father]] ([[castration]] [[anxiety]]), while the [[girl]] sees herself as already castrated (by the [[mother]]) and attempts to deny this or to compensate for it by seeking a [[child]] as a [[substitute]] for the [[penis]].  These unconscious representations, in phantasy, cover over the lack at the heart of being in the Other and allow the subject to imagine (feel) as though they are special or fulfilled (not lacking).  Fear of psychic castration is thus met with a phantasy which positions the subject as not lacking which props up the ego as being of central importance.

===Phallic Phase===
The [[castration complex]] affects both [[sex]]es because its appearance is closely linked with the [[castration complex|phallic phase]], a moment of [[development|psychosexual development]] when the [[child]], whether [[boy]] or [[girl]], knows only one [[penis|genital organ]] - the [[male]] one.  This [[phase]] is also known as the [[castration complex|infantile genital organisation]] because it is the first moment when the [[drive|partial drive]]s are unified under the primacy of the genital organs.  It thus anticipates the [[genital|genital organisation]] proper which arises at [[development|puberty]], when the [[subject]] is aware of both the [[male]] and the [[female]] [[biology|sexual organ]]s.<ref>{{F}} "[[Works of Sigmund Freud|The Infantile Genital Organization]]." 1923. [[SE]] XIX. p. 141</ref>

===Oedipus Complex===
[[Freud]] argued that the [[castration complex]] is closely linked to the [[Oedipus complex]], but that its role in the [[Oedipus complex]] is different for the [[boy]] and the [[girl]]. In the case of the [[boy]], the [[castration complex]] is the point of exit from the [[Oedipus complex]], its terminal crisis; because of his [[fear]] of [[castration]] -- often aroused by a [[fear|threat]] -- the [[boy]] renounces his [[desire]] for the [[mother]] and thus enters the [[development|latency period]]. In the case of the [[girl]], the [[castration complex]] is the point of entry into the [[Oedipus complex]]; it is her resentment of the [[mother]], whom she blames for depriving her of the [[penis]], that causes her to redirect her [[libido|libidinal]] [[desire]]s away from the [[mother]] and onto the [[father]]. Because of this [[sexual difference|difference]], in the case of the [[girl]] the [[Oedipus complex]] has no definitive terminal crisis comparable to the [[boy]]'s.<ref>{{F}} "[[Works of Sigmund Freud|The Dissolution of the Oedipus Complex]]," 1924. [[SE]] XIX p. 173</ref>

<!-- ===Treatment=== -->
<!-- [[Freud]] came to see the [[castration complex]] as a universal phenomenon, one which is rooted in a basic "rejection of femininity" (''Ablehnung der Weiblich-keit''). It is encountered in every [[subject]], and represents the ultimate limit beyond which [[psychoanalytic treatment]] cannot go.<ref>{{F}} "[[Works of Sigmund Freud|Analysis Terminable and Interminable]]," 1937. [[SE]] XXIII. p. 211</ref>-->

==Jacques Lacan==
<!-- ===Fantasy of the Mutilation of the Penis=== -->
<!-- [[Lacan]] -- who talks more often about "[[castration]]" than the "[[castration complex]]" -- does not discuss the [[castration complex]] very much in his early work. He dedicates a few paragraphs to it in his article on the [[family]], where he follows [[Freud]] in stating that [[castration]] is first and foremost a [[fantasy]] of the mutilation of the [[penis]]. [[Lacan]] links this [[fantasy]] with a whole series of [[fantasy|fantasies]] of bodily dismemberment which originate in the [[image]] of the [[fragmented body]]; this [[image]] is contemporary with the [[mirror stage]] (six to eighteen months), and it is only much later that these [[fantasy|fantasies]] of dismemberment coalesce around the specific [[fantasy]] of [[castration]].<ref>{{1938}} p. 44</ref> -->

===Symbolic Lack of an Imaginary Object===
It is not until the mid-1950s that the [[castration complex]] comes to play a prominent role in [[Lacan]]'s [[seminars|teaching]], primarily in [[the seminar of 1956-7]]. It is in this [[seminar]] that [[Lacan]] identifies [[castration complex|castration]] as one of three forms of "[[lack|lack of object]]", the others being [[frustration]] and [[privation]]. Unlike [[frustration]] -- which is an [[imaginary]] [[lack]] of a [[real]] [[object]] -- and [[privation]] -- which is a [[real]] [[lack]] of a [[symbolic]] [[object]], [[castration complex|castration]] is defined by [[Lacan]] as a [[symbolic]] [[lack]] of an [[imaginary]] [[object]]; [[castration complex|castration]] does not bear on the [[penis]] as a [[real]] [[biology|organ]], but on the [[imaginary]] [[phallus]].<ref>{{S4}} p. 219</ref> [[Lacan]]'s account of the [[castration complex]] is thus raised out of the dimension of simple [[biology]] or [[biology|anatomy]]: 

<blockquote>"It is insoluble by any reduction to biological givens."<ref>{{E}} p. 282</ref></blockquote>

===Oedipus Complex===
Following [[Freud]], [[Lacan]] argues that the [[castration complex]] is the pivot on which the whole [[Oedipus complex]] turns.<ref>{{S4}} p. 216</ref> However, whereas [[Freud]] argues that these two [[complex]]es are articulated differently in [[boy]]s and [[girl]]s, [[Lacan]] argues that the [[castration complex]] always denotes the final moment of the [[Oedipus complex]] in both sexes. 

[[Lacan]] divides the [[Oedipus complex]] into three "[[Oedipus complex|times]]".<ref>{{S5}}; [[Seminar]] of 22 January 1958</ref>
# In the first time, the [[child]] perceives that the [[mother]] [[desire]]s something beyond the [[child]] himself - namely, the [[imaginary]] [[phallus]] -- and then tries to be the [[phallus]] for the [[mother]] (see [[preoedipal phase]]).
# In the second time, the [[imaginary]] [[father]] intervenes to deprive the [[mother]] of her [[object]] by promulgating the [[incest taboo]]; properly speaking, this is not [[castration complex|castration]] but [[privation]]. 
# [[castration complex|Castration]] is only realized in the third and final time, which represents the "dissolution" of the [[Oedipus complex]]. It is then that the [[real]] [[father]] intervenes by showing that he really possesses the [[phallus]], in such a way that the [[child]] is forced to abandon his attempts to be the [[phallus]].<ref>{{S4}} p. 208-9, 227</ref>

<!-- ==Two Operations== -->
<!-- From this account of the [[Oedipus complex]], it is clear that [[Lacan]] uses the term "[[castration]]" to refer to two different operations. -->
<!-- ===Castration of the Mother===
<!-- [[Lacan]] often uses the term "[[castration complex|castration]]" to speak of the [[castration complex|castration]] -- or, more precisely, the "[[privation]]" -- of the [[mother]]. In the [[first time]] of the [[Oedipus complex]], "the mother is considered, by both sexes, as possessing the phallus, as the phallic mother."<ref>{{E}} p.282</ref>  By promulgating the [[incest taboo]] in the [[second time]], the [[imaginary]] [[father]] is seen to deprive her of this [[phallus]]. However, [[Lacan]] himself often uses these terms interchangeably, speaking both of the [[privation]] of the [[mother]] and of her [[castration complex|castration]].
<!-- ===Castration of the Subject===  -->
<!-- This is [[castration complex|castration]] proper, in the sense of being a [[symbolic]] [[act]] which bears on an [[imaginary]] [[object]]. Whereas the [[castration complex|castration]]/[[privation]] of the [[mother]] which comes about in the second time of the [[Oedipus complex]] negates the verb "to have" -- the [[mother]] does not have the [[phallus]], the [[castration complex|castration]] of the [[subject]] in the third time of the [[Oedipus complex]] negates the verb "to be" -- the [[subject]] must renounce his attempts to be the [[phallus]] for the [[mother]]. -->

The [[subject]] must renounce his attempts to be the [[phallus]] for the [[mother]].  In renouncing his attempts to be the [[object]] of the [[mother]]'s [[desire]], the [[subject]] gives up a certain ''[[jouissance]]'' which is never regained despite all attempts to do so:
<blockquote>"Castration means that ''jouissance'' must be refused so that it can be reached on the inverted ladder (''l'èchelle renversè'') of the [[Law]] of [[desire]]."<ref>{{E}} p. 324</ref></blockquote>

This applies equally to [[boy]]s and [[girl]]s:
<blockquote>"[This] relationship to the phallus .  . . is established without regard to the anatomical difference of the sexes."<ref>{{E}} p. 282</ref></blockquote>

<!-- ====Lack==== -->
On a more fundamental level, the term [[castration complex|castration]] may also refer not to an "operation" -- the result of an intervention by the [[imaginary]] or [[real]] [[father]] -- but to a state of [[lack]] which already exists in the [[mother]] prior to the [[subject]]'s birth. This [[lack]] is evident in her own [[desire]], which the [[subject]] perceives as a [[desire]] for the [[imaginary]] [[phallus]]. That is, the [[subject]] realises at a very early stage that the [[mother]] is not [[lack|complete]] and [[autonomy|self-sufficient]] in herself, nor fully [[satisfied]] with her [[child]] (the [[subject]] himself), but [[desire]]s something else. This is the [[subject]]'s first perception that the [[Other]] is not [[lack|complete]] but [[lack]]ing.

<!-- 
==="Normalizing Effect"=== 
The [[castration complex]] presents the [[subject]] with a choice: to accept [[castration complex|castration]] or to deny it. [[Lacan]] argues that it is only by accepting (or "assuming") [[castration complex|castration]] that the [[subject]] can reach a degree of [[psyche|psychic]] [[perversion|normality]]. In other words, the assumption of [[castration complex|castration]] has a "[[normalizing effect]]". This [[normalising effect]] is to be understood in terms of both [[psychopathology]] ([[clinic]]al [[structure]]s and [[symptom]]s) and [[sexual identity]].
-->
===Clinical Structures===
It is the refusal of [[castration complex|castration]] that lies at the root of all [[neurosis|psychopathological]] [[structure]]s. However, since it is impossible to accept [[castration complex|castration]] entirely, a completely "normal" position is never achieved. The closest to such a position is the [[neurosis|neurotic]] [[structure]], but even here the [[subject]] still defends himself against the [[lack]] in the [[Other]] by repressing awareness of [[castration complex|castration]]. This prevents the [[neurotic]] from fully assuming his [[desire]], since "it is the assumption of castration that creates the lack upon which desire is instituted."<ref>{{Ec}} p. 852</ref>

A more radical [[defense]] against [[castration complex|castration]] than [[repression]] is [[disavowal]], which is at the root of the [[perversion|perverse]] [[structure]].  The [[psychotic]] takes the most extreme path of all; he completely repudiates [[castration complex|castration]], as if it had never existed.<ref>{{S1}} p. 53</ref> This repudiation of [[castration complex|symbolic castration]] leads to the return of [[castration complex|castration]] in the [[real]], such as in the form of [[hallucinations]] of [[fragmented body|dismemberment]] (as in the case of the [[Wolf Man]]) or even self-mutilation of the [[real]] [[genital|genital organ]]s.

<!-- 
====Perversion====
A more radical [[defense]] against [[castration complex|castration]] than [[repression]] is [[disavowal]], which is at the root of the [[perversion|perverse]] [[structure]]. 
-->
<!-- 
====Psychosis====
The [[psychotic]] takes the most extreme path of all; he completely repudiates [[castration complex|castration]], as if it had never existed.<ref>{{S1}} p. 53</ref> This repudiation of [[castration complex|symbolic castration]] leads to the return of [[castration complex|castration]] in the [[real]], such as in the form of [[hallucinations]] of [[fragmented body|dismemberment]] (as in the case of the [[Wolf Man]]) or even self-mutilation of the [[real]] [[genital|genital organ]]s.
-->
<!-- 
===Castration and Sexual Identity===
It is only by assuming [[castration complex|castration]] (in both senses) that the [[subject]] can take up a [[sexual difference|sexual position]] as a [[man]] or a [[woman]]. The different modalities of refusing [[castration complex|castration]] find expression in the various forms of [[perversion]].
