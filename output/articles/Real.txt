The "[[real]]" stands for what is neither [[symbolic]] nor [[imaginary]].

It forms part of a subjects reality, however it is never truly known, it is mediated by the two orders of the Imaginary and the Symbolic, thus while it is present, the subject treats it as inherently Othered and alien. It is most notably discussed in Freudian theory as 'Das Ding'. This is furthered in Lacan who often cites these Uncanny objects as reminders of symbolic lack in the subjects identity formation.
