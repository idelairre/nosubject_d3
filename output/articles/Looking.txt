LOOKING, DESIRE FOR-
<blockquote>The desire for looking becomes a perversion (a) when it is exclusively limited to the genitals; (b) when it becomes connected with the overcoming of loathing (voyeurs and onlookers at the functions of excretion); and (c) when instead of preparing for the normal sexual aim, it suppresses it.<ref>{{TCTS}} I</ref></blockquote>
