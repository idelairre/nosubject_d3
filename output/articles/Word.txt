<blockquote>When I began to teach something about [[Psychoanalysis]] I lost some of my audience, because I had perceived long before then the simple fact that if you open a book of [[Freud]], and particularly those books which are properly about the [[unconscious]], you can be absolutely sure -- it is not a probability but a certitude -- to fall on a page where it is not only a question of [[word]]s -- naturally in a book there are always words many printed words -- but [[word]]s which are the [[object]] through which one seeks for a way to handle the  [[unconscious]].  Not even the meaning of the [[word]]s, but [[word]]s in their flesh, in their [[material]] aspect.  A great part of the speculations of [[Freud]] is about [[pun]]ning in a [[dream]] or [[lapsus]], or what in French we call <i>calembour, homonymie</i>, or still the division of a word into many parts with each part taking on a new meaning after it is broken down.  It is curious to note, even if in this case it is not absolutely proven, that words are the only [[material]] of the [[unconscious]]. It is not proven but it is probable (and in any case I have never said that the [[unconscious]] was an assemblage of [[word]]s, but that the [[unconscious]] is precisely [[structure]]d).  I don't think there is such an [[English]] word but it is necessary to have this term, as we are talking about [[structure]] and the [[unconscious is structured as a language]].  What does that mean?<ref>[[Of Structure as an Inmixing of an Otherness Prerequisite to Any Subject Whatever]]</ref></blockquote>
