SEXUAL INSTINCT AND LIBIDO

<blockquote>The fact of sexual need in man and animal is expressed in biology by the assumption of a "sexual instinct." This instinct is made analogous to the instinct of taking nourishment, and to hunger. The sexual expression corresponding to hunger not being found colloquially, science uses the expression, "libido."<ref>{{TCTS}} I</ref></blockquote>
