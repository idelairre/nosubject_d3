An important distinction in [[Saussure]]'s [[linguistics]] which poses considerable translation problems.
Unlike English, French has two terms that can both mean 'language': ''langage'' and ''langue'', as in ''la langue franCaise'' ('the French language').
''Langage'' tends, in contrast, to be used of the human faculty of language in the abstract philosophical sense, and not of specific natural languages.
''Parole'' can be translated as both ''speech'' and ''word''.
Because it is so difficult to find strict equivalents in English, it has become conventional to use the French terms.

[[Saussure]] follows the norms of French usage in using ''langage'' to refer ot the phenomenon of [[language]] insofar as it is a human attribute.
''Langue'', in contrast, is defined as the social aspect of [[language]].
It has little to do with individuals, and can be described as the product of a [[linguistic]] contact between all members of a [[community]].
''Langue'' consists of [[sign]]s organized into a system and expressive of ideas.
As the [[sign]]s constituting it are arbitrary and purely conventional, it is the differences between them that confer [[meaning]] upon them.
''Langue'' can therefore be said to be an organized system of differences.
''Langue'' is the [[object]] of [[semiology]], or the [[science]] that studies the life of [[sign]]s within society.

''Parole'', in contrast, refers to the individual aspect of [[language]], or to the actual manifestations of ''langue'' in individual [[speech act]]s.
The relationship between ''langue'' and ''parole'' takes the form of a [[dialectic]]: at the level of ''parole'' individuals are creative agents whose linguistic innovations can modify ''langue'', but only by becoming impersonal elements of a system over which individuals have no control.
The [[dialectic]] between the two aspects of [[language]] is the motor-force behind linguistic evolution.
