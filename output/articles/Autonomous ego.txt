==Ego-Psychology==
The term "[[autonomous ego]]" was coined by the proponents of [[ego-psychology]]. 

==Adaptation==
According to the proponents of [[ego-psychology]], the [[ego]] becomes [[autonomous]] by achieving a [[adaptation|harmonious balance]] between its primitive [[drive]]s and the dictates of [[reality]]. 

The [[autonomous ego]] is thus synomymous with "the strong ego," "the well-adapted ego," "the healthy ego." 

==Identification==
[[Psychoanalysis]] was conceived of by the proponents of [[ego-psychology]] as the process of helping the [[analysand]] [[ego]] to become [[autonomous]]: this was supposed to be achieved by the [[identification]] of the [[analysand]] with the strong [[ego]] of the [[analyst]].

==Narcissism==
[[Lacan]] is very critical of the concept of the [[autonomous ego]].<ref>{{E}} p.306-7</ref> 

He argues that the [[ego]] is not free but determined by the [[symbolic order]]. 

==Symbolic Order==
The [[autonomy]] of the [[ego]] is simply a [[narcissistic]] [[illusion]] of [[mastery]]. 

It is the [[symbolic order]], and not the [[ego]], which enjoys [[autonomy]].
