=====Signifier and Signified=====
[[Lacan]] uses the verb "[[slip]]" -- and its corresponding noun, "[[slip|slippage]]" -- to describe the unstable relationship between the [[signifier]] and the [[signified]].

=====Signification=====
The term thus emphasizes the different ways in which [[Saussure]] and [[Lacan]] conceive of [[signification]]; for [[Saussure]], [[signification]] was a stable bond between [[signifier]] and [[signified]], but for [[Lacan]] it is an unstable, fluid relationship.

=====Bar=====
It is impossible to establish a stable one-to-one link between [[signifier]]s and [[signified]]s, and [[Lacan]] symbolizes this by inscribing a [[bar]] between them in the [[Saussurean algorithm]].

=====Point de capiton=====
The [[signified]] slips and slides under the [[bar]] of the [[Saussurean algorithm]] in a continuous movement, a movement which is only temporarily detained by the ''[[points de capiton]]''.<ref>{{E}} p.154</ref>

=====Psychosis=====
When there are not enough ''[[points de capiton]]'', as is in the case in [[psychosis]], the slippery movement of [[signification]] is endless, and stable meanings dissolve altogether.
