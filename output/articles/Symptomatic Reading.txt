The practice of reading described by [[Althusser]] in his attempt to demonstrate that the [[problematic]] of [[Marx]] is divorced by an [[epistemological break]] from that of the [[classical political economy]] of [[Adam Smith]] And [[David Ricardo]].
A [[symptomatic reading]] concentrates not on the obvious features of the text itself, but on the silences, gaps and contradictions that reveal its [[problematic]].
[[Symptomatic reading]] is held by [[Althusser]] to be analogous to the evenly suspended or poised attention with which a [[psychoanalyst]] listens to a [[patient]]'s [[free association]]s.
