The subject (as lack) is always attempting to cover over its constitutive lack on the level of representation, through continuous identification acts.

"One needs to identify with something because there is an originary and insurmountable lack of identity."<ref>Laclau, 1994: 3</ref>

It is the constitution of every identity through a process of identification that reproduces lack within subjective structure.
