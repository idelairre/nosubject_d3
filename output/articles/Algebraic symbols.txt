[[Algebra]] ([[Fr]]. ''[[algèbre]]'')  is a branch of [[mathematics]] 
* which reduces the solution of problems to manipulations of [[symbolic]] expressions, and
* concerned with the properties and relationships of abstract entities represented in symbolic form.

==Jacques Lacan==
[[Jacques Lacan]] begins to use [[algebraic]] [[symbol]]s in 1955 -- in an attempt to [[formalise]] [[psychoanalysis]].

===Formalization of Psychoanalysis===

Three main reasons lie behind this attempt at [[formalization]].

:1. [[Formalization]] is necessary for [[psychoanalysis]] to acquire [[scientific]] status.

:Just as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] uses quasi-mathematical formulae in an attempt to set [[anthropology]] on a more [[scientific]] footing, [[Lacan]] attempts to do the same for [[psychoanalysis]]

:[[Lacan]] used quasi-mathematical formulae in an attempt to set [[psychoanalysis]] on a more [[scientific]] footing.

:2. [[Formalization]] can provide a core of [[psychoanalytic theory]] which can be transmitted integrally even to those who have never experienced [[psychoanalytic treatment]].

:The [[matheme|formulae]] thus become an essential aspect of the [[training]] of [[psychoanalysis]] which take their place alongside [[training|training analysis]] as a medium for the transmission of [[psychoanalytic]] [[knowledge]].

:3. [[Formalization]] of [[psychoanalytic theory]] in terms of [[algebraic]] [[symbols]] is a means of preventing [[knowledge|intuitive understanding]], which [[Lacan]] regards as an [[imaginary]] [[lure]] which hinders access to the [[symbolic]].

:Rather than being understood in an intuitive way, the [[algebraic]] [[symbols]] are to be used, manipulated and read in various different ways.<ref>{{E}} p.313</ref>

==List of Algebraic Symbols==

The [[algebraic]] [[symbol]]s used by [[Lacan]] appear principally in the [[matheme]]s, [[schema l]] and the [[graph of desire]]. 

It is important to remember that the [[symbol]]s do not always refer to the same concept throughout [[Lacan]]'s work, but are used in different ways as his work develops.
