=====The Marienbad Congress=====
[[Lacan]] made his first intervention at the annual Congress of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]], held at [[Marienbad]], in [[{{Y}}#1936|1936]].  He developed the thesis of the "[[mirror phase]]."  The original text of this paper is lost, but the brilliant article on the [[family]] which [[Lacan]] contributed to the ''[[Encyclopédie Française]]'' in [[{{Y}}#1938|1938]], together with a later version of the paper, presents the argument clearly.
<!-- But his paper was interruted by the chairman of the session, Ernest Jones, Freud's biographer. -->
