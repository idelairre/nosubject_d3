In the [[completed graph]] there are not one but two [[signifying chain]]s.

The lower [[chain]] (from the [[signifier]] to the [[voice]]) is the [[conscious]] [[signifying chain]], the level of the [[statement]].

The upper [[chain]] (from ''[[jouissance]]'' to [[castration]]) is the [[signifying chain]] in the [[unconscious]], the level of the [[enunciation]].

The [[structure]] is thus duplicated: the upper part of the [[graph]] is structured exactly like the lower part.

Lacan introduces two new siglas here: S(<strike>O</strike>) and ($<>D).

These two siglas from the upper part of the graph hold a position structurally homologous to the position of the symols O and s(O) from the lower part.
