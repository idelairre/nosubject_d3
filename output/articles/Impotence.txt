IMPOTENCE, PSYCHIC

<blockquote>The sexual function is subject to a great multiplicity of disturbances, the majority of which have the character of simple inhibitions. These are grouped together as psychic impotence.<ref>{{PoA}} Ch. 1</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>Here again-as very probably in all neurotic disorders-the root of the trouble lies in an arrest occurring during the course of development of the libido to that ultimate form which may be called normal.<ref>{{CPL-DEL}}</ref></blockquote>
