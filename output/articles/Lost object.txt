According to [[Sigmund Freud]], the [[loss]] of the [[object]] is a two-step process whereby the [[subject]] is constituted. 

First, the earliest [[partial object]], the [[breast]], is [[lost]]. 

Then the primary [[love]] [[object]], the [[mother]], is likewise [[lost]].

The earliest [[sexual]] [[object]] is the [[breast]], and the earliest source of [[satisfaction]] for the [[sexual]] [[instinct]] is the encounter between two [[partial object]]s, the [[infant]]'s [[mouth]] and the [[mother]]'s [[breast]]. 

In <i>[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]</i> (1905), [[Freud]] explained that the [[breast]] becomes a [[lost object]] "just at the time, perhaps, when the [[child]] is able to form a [[total]] [[idea]] of the person to whom the organ that is giving him [[satisfaction]] belongs."<ref>[[Freud, Sigmund]]. [[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]. 1905. p. 222</ref>

[[Loss]] of the [[object]] of the [[oral]] [[instinct]] is thus a precondition of access to the [[total]] person as a possible [[love]] [[object]]. 

At the same time, however, this [[loss]] opens the door to [[autoeroticism]] for the [[infant]] as the [[infant]] assumes a [[complete]] [[body]] [[image]]. 

The [[infant]], though in a [[passive]] [[position]], is [[active]] with regard to a part of its own [[body]], and this enables the [[infant]] to find a [[source]] of [[satisfaction]] that is the first [[substitute]] for the [[breast]].

Later the [[lost object]] becomes the "[[whole]] person" in the context of the "[[Fort/Da]]" [[game]] described by [[Freud]] in <i>[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]</i> (1920). 

Here [[separation]] from the [[object]] is addressed in two ways: 
# either the [[child]] expresses an impulse to [[master]] the [[object]] by breaking it, casting it aside, or incorporating it in [[fantasy]] (and so working it over in the [[psyche]]), or 
# the [[child]] bypasses the [[need]] for the [[object]] by regarding it as a [[lost object]] beyond the reach of the [[self]]. 
With the recognition of the [[absence]] of the [[object]], therefore, the [[child]] makes a transition, as a result of working over in the [[psyche]], to a capacity to do without the [[object]].

When the [[subject]] does not recognize the [[object]] as [[lost]], as in [[melancholia]], the [[object]] is incorporated in [[fantasy]], where it maintains a [[silent]] [[existence]] within the [[subject]]. 

[[Freud]] described this process in "[[Mourning and Melancholia]]" (1915). 

[[Object]] [[loss]] can also provoke [[anxiety]], [[mourning]], or [[pain]], as [[Freud]] outlined in <i>[[Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety]]</i> (1925).

==Post-Freudian==
After [[Freud]], a number of [[psychoanalyst]]s took up the [[lost object]] and developed it in their theories. 

[[Melanie Klein]] described [[internal]] [[object]]s in "[[Mourning and Its Relation to Manic-Depressive States]]" (1935). 

[[Jacques Lacan]] theorized that ''[[objet a]]'' is [[substitute]]d for the [[lost object]]. 

And Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok related [[mourning]] and [[melancholia]] to the [[lost object]].
