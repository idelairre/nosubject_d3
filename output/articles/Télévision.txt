=====Overview=====
[[Lacan]] made his debut on television on two shows produced by Benoît Jacquot, under the title ''Psychoanalysis''. 

He was questioned by [[Jacques-Alain Miller]] who, afterwards, wrote the transcription of the discussions to be published by the Editions du Seuil. 


[[Lacan]] began with a statement that has become famous:

<blockquote>"I always speak the truth. Not the whole truth, because there's no way, to say it all. Saying it all is materially impossible: words fail. Yet it is through this very impossibility that the truth holds onto the real."</blockquote>


Although he continues to stress the [[linguistics|linguistic]] nature of the [[unconscious]], here and in [[Seminar XX]] [[Lacan]] begins to use the neologism ''[[linguisterie]]'' to indicate the distance that separates him from academic linguists.

Many of the themes of [[Seminar XX]] and related texts are restated in [[matheme|schematic form]].
