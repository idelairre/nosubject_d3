==Jacques Lacan==
The term "[[existence]]" is employed by [[Lacan]] in various ways:

==Symbolic==
This sense of [[existence]] is to be understood in the context of [[Freud]]'s discussion of the "judgement of existence," by which the [[existence]] of an entity is affirmed prior to attributing any quality to it. 

Only what is integrated in the [[symbolic]] [[order]] fully "[[exist]]s", since "there is no such thing as a prediscursive reality."<ref>{{S20}} p. 33</ref>

==="Woman Does Not Exist"===
It is in this sense that [[Lacan]] argues that "[[woman|woman does not exist]];"<ref>{{TV}} p. 60</ref> the [[symbolic order]] contains no [[signifier]] for [[femininity]], and hence the [[feminine position]] cannot be fully [[symbolize]]d.

===Non-Existence===
It is important to note that, in the [[symbolic order]], "nothing exists except on an assumed foundation of [[absence]]. Nothing exists except insofar as it does not exist."<ref>{{Ec}} p.392</ref>

In other words, everything that exists in the [[symbolic order]] only exists by virtue of its difference to everything else. 

It was [[Saussure]] who first pointed this out when he argued that in [[language]] there are no positive terms, only differences.<ref>[[Saussure|Saussure, Ferdinand de]]. (1916) ''[[Saussure|Course in General Linguistics]]'', ed. Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye, trans. Wade Baskin, Glasgow: Collins Fontana.</ref>

==Real==
In this sense, it is only that which is [[impossible]] to [[symbolize]] that [[exists]]: the [[impossible]] [[Thing]] at the heart of the [[subject]]. 

<blockquote>"There is in effect something radically unassimilable to the signifier.  It's quite simply the subject's singular existence."<ref>{{S3}} p.179</ref></blockquote>

===Subject of the Unconscious===
This is the [[existence]] of the [[subject]] of the [[unconscious]], '''S''', which [[Lacan]] describes as an "ineffable, stupid [[existence]]."<ref>{{E}} p.194</ref>

===Being===
This second sense of the term [[existence]] is exactly the opposite of [[existence]] in the first sense. 

Whereas [[existence]] in the first sense is synonymous with [[Lacan]]'s use of the term [[being]], [[existence]] in the second sense is opposed to [[being]].

===''Ex-sistence''===
[[Lacan]] coins the neologism ''[[existence|ex-sistence]]'' to express the idea that the heart of our [[being]] (''Kern unseres Wesen'') is also radically [[Other]], strange, [[outside]];<ref>{{Ec}} p.11</ref> the [[subject]] is decentered, his center is [[outside]] of himself, he is [[extimacy|ex-centric]].

[[Lacan]] also speaks of the "[[existence|ex-sistence]] (''[[existence|Entstellung]]'') of desire in the dream,"<ref>{{E}} p.264</ref> since the [[dream]] cannot represent [[desire]] except by distorting it.
