Generally used in [[psychoanalysis]] to refer to the individual's interaction withthe [[object]]s and [[part-object]]s that constitute his or her environment.

[[Object-relations theory]] attempts to avoid [[Freud]]'s tendency to speak of the [[subject]] in isolation and to introduce an interpersonal dimension into [[psychoanalysis]].

The so-called "[[object-relations theory|object-relations school]]" is the majority tendency within British psychoanalysis.

Strongly influenced by [[Klein]], [[Winnicot]] and [[Anna Freud]], it gives primary importance to the early relationship between [[mother]] and [[child]] rather than the [[father]]-[[child]] relationship that is so important in [[Freud]]'s own writings, and has helped to produced a "mother-centered psychoanalysis."

[[Object-relations]] analysts use a number of different approaches and, whilst they share similar conceptions, do not really subscribe to a fixed body of theoretical principles.

In historical terms, the group, sometimes described as the independent group, developed out of the need to find a working compromise between the followers of [[Anna Freud]] and those of [[Klein]].
