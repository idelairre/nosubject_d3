Totem and Taboo is Sigmund Freud's first work on group psychology. The foundation of the work's ideas first appears in 1911, in his correspondence with SÃ¡ndor Ferenczi, through which it is possible to trace the development of Freud's thought. Two topics appear in the letters: "tragic guilt" and the "libidinal origin of religion." His competition with Carl Jung, who was writing the ''Metamorphoses of the Soul and its Symbols'' (1912), is mentioned, and their break in fact occurred while the book was being written.
