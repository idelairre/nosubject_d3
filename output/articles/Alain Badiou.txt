[[Alain Badiou]] (born 1937, Rabat, Morocco) is a prominent [[France|French]] [[left-wing]] [[philosopher]] formerly chair of [[Philosophy]] at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS).

==Biography==
Badiou was trained formally as a [[philosopher]] as a student at the ENS from 1956 to 1961, a period during which he took courses at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. He had a lively and constant interest in mathematics. He was politically active very early on, and was one of the founding members of the [[United Socialist Party (France)|United Socialist Party]] (PSU), an offshoot of the [[French Communist Party]]. The PSU was particularly active in the struggle for the [[decolonization]] of [[Algeria]]. He wrote his first novel, [[Almagestes]], in 1964. In 1967 he joined a study group organized by [[Louis Althusser]] and grew increasingly influenced by [[Jacques Lacan]].

The student uprisings of [[May 1968]] had a huge impact on Badiou. While 1968 politicized many [[intellectual]]s, it served to reinforce Badiou's commitment to the [[far left]], and he continued to organize [[communist]] and [[Maoist]] groups such as the UCFML. In 1969 he joined the faculty of [[University of Paris]] VIII (Vincennes-Saint Denis), which was a bastion of counter-cultural thought. There he engaged in fierce intellectual debates with fellow professors [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], whose [[leftist]] philosophy he considered an unhealthy deviation of more main-line [[Marxism]]. In 1988 he published what is now considered by many to be his major statement, ''L'être et l'événement''. He took up his current position at the ENS in 1999. He is also associated with a number of other institutions, such as the [[European Graduate School]] and the [[Collège International de Philosophie]]. He is now a member of "L'Organisation Politique" which he founded with some comrades from the Maoist UCFML in 1985.
