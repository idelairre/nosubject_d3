==Spectral Supplement==
[[Žižek]]'s argument is that it is this [[spectral]] [[supplement]] that constitutes the basis of all [[ideologies]]. 
Furthermore, he avers that [[reality]] itself depends on this [[supplement]]. 
This concept relies on our understanding the distinction between [[reality]] and the [[Real]]. 
We have no access to the [[Real]] because our [[world]] is always mediated by the [[Symbolic]]. 
[[Reality]], as we know it, therefore, is always [[Symbolic]]. However, the [[Symbolization]] of the [[Real]] is, and cannot be, complete. 
The [[Symbolic]] can never saturate the [[Real]] and so, consequently, there is always some part of the [[Real]] which remains [[unsymbolized]]. 
What cannot be accommodated in the [[Symbolic]] produces a fundamental [[antagonism]]. It is this part of the [[Real]] that returns to haunt [[reality]] in the guise of the [[spectral]] [[supplement]].

The [[spectre]] conceals the piece of the [[Real]] which has to be forsaken if [[reality]] (in the guise of the [[Symbolic]]) is to [[exist]]. 
And it is here, in the [[spectral]] [[supplement]], that [[Žižek]] locates the foundation or kernel of all [[ideologies]]. 
All of which is another way of saying that [[reality]] and [[ideology]] are mutually implicated in each other. 
One cannot exist without the other.<ref>{{Myers}} p.75</ref>
