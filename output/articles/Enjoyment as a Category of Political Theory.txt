<blockquote>"All politics relies upon, and even manipulates, a certain economy of enjoyment."<ref>[[Slavoj Žižek]] and Glyn Daly. ''Conversations with Žižek''. Cambridge, U.K.: Polity, 2004. p. 114</ref></blockquote>


Throughout his [[Slavoj Žižek:Books|work]], [[Žižek]] draws out the workings of [[enjoyment]] (what [[Jacques Lacan]] calls ''[[jouissance]]'') in [[racism|racist]] and [[racism|ethnic]] [[ideology|ideological]] [[fantasy|fantasies]], in [[socialism]]'s [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[excess]]es, and in the [[cynicism]] of the [[narcissism|narcissistic]] [[subject]]s of [[capitalism|late capitalism]].

[[Žižek]] frequently invokves the seemingly nonsensical ceremonies and redundancies that accompany political institutions.

<blockquote>"Our politics is more and more directly the politics of ''jouissance'', concerned with ways of soliciting, or controlling and regulating, ''jouissance''."<ref>{{Z}} ''[[The Parallax View]]''. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2006. p. 309</ref></blockquote>


In this chapter [[Dean]] introduces the category of [[enjoyment]] as the key to understanding [[Žižek]]'s [[Slavoj Žižek:Politics|political thought]].

[[Dean]] demonstrates the importance of [[enjoyment]] as a category of political theory.

----

It contributes to thinking about our attachment to and investment in violent, destructive, and authoritarian modes of being.

For political theorists, his work is indispensable to understanding the deep libidinal attraction of domination, that is, the passion of our attachments to objects constitutive of our subjectivities.

----

In considering [[enjoyment]] as a category of political theory, [[Dean]] begins with a general discussion of the concept in [[psychoanalysis]].

She then turns specifically to [[Žižek]]'s work, taking up the role of [[enjoyment]] and [[fantasy]] in his reworking of the theory of [[ideology]].

After attending to the place of [[enjoyment]] in [[ideology|ideological]] [[interpellation]] and addressing more specifically [[Žižek]]'s use of the concept for understanding [[racism]] and [[racism|ethnic nationalism]], [[Dean]] analyzes some of the specific, formal features of the concept.

Here she emphasizes [[enjoyment]] as it fixes the place of the [[subject]], [[enjoyment]] and our relation to others, and the [[superego]] support of [[enjoyment]].

Then [[Dean]] argues for [[Žižek]]'s account of the challenges of freedomin in communicative capitalism as a compelling alternative to current emphases on multiplicity and pluralization.

[[Žižek]]'s emphasis on [[enjoyment]] enables us to confront the [[excess]]es generated by [[capitalism|global capitalism]] as they fix and attach contemporary [[subject]]s into relations of domination and exploitation.


==''What is Enjoyment?''==









The basic psychoanalytic account of [[enjoyment]] tells a story of the infant's primary connection with its [[mother]].

This story begins by positing an ideal oneness that was never fully realized, but whose loss helsps make sense oof human psychic life.
