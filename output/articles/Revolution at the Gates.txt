Žižek, S. (ed.) (2002) Revolution at the Gates: Selected Writings of Lenin
from 1917, London and New York: Verso.
Continuing with his project to disinter nuggets of political wisdom
from those figures who are conventionally reviled, Žižek here avers that
Lenin demonstrated an admirable ability to grasp the significance of an
open and contingent moment in history. As such, Lenin figures for Žižek
as a vanishing mediator, one whose insights could be productively rein-
vigorated in an era of multinational capitalism. In terms of Žižek's work
as a whole, then, this text furthers his commitment - more evident
in his recent books  - to find a way to build trans-national political
movements and institutions strong enough to seriously constrain the
unlimited rule of capital and the liberal-democratic consensus.
