The earliest [[stage]] in your [[psychosexual development]] (0-6 months), according to [[Julia Kristeva]]. 

In this [[linguistics|pre-lingual]] [[stage]] of [[development]], you were dominated by a chaotic mix of [[perception]]s, [[feeling]]s, and [[need]]s. 

You did not distinguish your own [[self]] from that of your [[mother]] or even the world around you. 

Rather, you spent your time taking into yourself everything that you experienced as [[pleasurable]] without any acknowledgment of boundaries. 

This is the [[stage]], then, when you were closest to the pure materiality of [[existence]], or what [[Lacan]] terms "the [[Real]]." 

At this stage, you were, according to [[Kristeva]], purely dominated by your [[drive]]s (both life drives and the [[death drive]]s).
