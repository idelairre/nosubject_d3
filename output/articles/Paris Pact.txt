When Jacques Lacan founded his School, the French School of Psychoanalysis, 24 June 1964, he launched an appeal to "reconquer" the Freudian Field, with the aim of re-establishing psychoanalysis on its proper path.
Lacan’s appeal resonated beyond the dissolution of the School he had founded, beyond his death, 9 th September 1981, and resonated well beyond Paris, where he lived and worked. The expansion, over the past ten years, of the network of the Foundation of the Freudian Field (a non-profit organization) is an indication of this.
The time has come to take the next step.
The School of the Lacanian Orientation’s foundation on 3 January last year, which brings the number of Schools of the Freudian Field to four, immediately opened the way to the creation of the World Association of Psychoanalysis. As this creation received the immediate approval of the four Schools, it was agreed to meet in Paris on 1 February to sign the present document. Consequently, the School of the Freudian Cause, the CaracasSchool of the Freudian Field, the European School of Psychoanalysis in the Freudian Field, the School of the Lacanian Orientation in the Freudian Field, and the World Association of Psychoanalysis agree to the following:
-That this day the four Schools join the World Association of Psychoanalysis, which accepts them as institutional members;
-That the members of the four Schools will automatically become members of the World Association, according to the rules established by the Council of each of the Schools;
-That the titles of the analytic grades recognized by the four Schools according to established procedures will be recognized by each and also by the World Association of Psychoanalysis.

It is also agreed:
- That the first "Convocation" of the World Association will take place in Caracas (Venezuela) next July;
- That the World Association will hold a General Assembly every two years, on the occasion of the International Encounters of the Freudian Field, the first taking place in 1994;
- That the World Association will publish an initial Directory, and that for this purpose each of the Schools will communicate as soon as possible, along with an electronic copy, a list of its members for publication in this Directory;
- That the amount of the initial annual subscription for members of the Association will be fixed by the signatories, representing the four Schools and the World Association.
The signatories agree to establish as soon as possible the text of the World Association’s Statutes which will be an appendix to this present pact.

Paris, 1 February 1992
