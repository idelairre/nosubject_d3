[[Jacques Lacan]] is one of the most challenging and controversial contemporary thinkers, as well as the most influential [[:Category:Psychoanalysts|psychoanalyst]] since [[Freud]].

This introduction provides an accessible guide to Lacanian concepts and his writing on:
* the [[imaginary]] and the [[symbolic]]
* the [[Oedipus]] [[complex]] and the [[meaning]] of the [[phallus]]
* the [[subject]] and the [[unconscious]]
* the [[real]]
* [[sexual difference]].

This introduction locates Lacan's work in the context of contemporary French thought and the history of [[psychoanalysis]].  With a unique focus on historical and intellectual contexts, the introduction examas Lacan's signifiance, motivation, key ideas and their sources, and his impact on other thinkers.
