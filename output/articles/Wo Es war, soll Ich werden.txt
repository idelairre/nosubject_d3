"[[Wo Es war, soll Ich werden]]" (''[[English]]'': "[[Where It was, shall I be]]") is a famous declaration by [[Freud]] about the relation between the [[unconscious]] and [[conscious]].

[[Freud]] hoped that, by bringing the contents of the [[unconscious]] into [[consciousness]], he could minimize [[repression]] and [[neurosis]]

The [[English]] translation of the German "[[Wo Es war, soll Ich werden]]" is "[[Where It was, shall I be]]".  In other words, the "[[it]]," or "[[id]]" ([[unconscious]]) will be replaced by the "[[I]]", by [[consciousness]] and [[identity|self-identity]].  

[[Freud]]'s goal was to strengthen the [[ego]], the "[[I]]" [[self]], the [[conscious]]/[[rational]] [[identity]], so it would be more powerful than the [[unconscious]].
