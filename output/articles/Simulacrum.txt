In Latin this word denoted a material representration or image, usually a deity.


==Baudrillard==
The term has been given a new importance by [[Baudrillard]]'s account of postmodernity.

A discussion of the role of the simulacrum in Greek and Roman theories of representation can be found in the Appendices to [[Deleuze]]'s ''Logic of Sense'' (1969).

[[Baudrillard]]'s most systematic expositions of his theory of simulacra are to be found in his ''Symbolic Exchange and Death'' (1976) and ''Simulacra and Simulations'' (1981).


For [[Baudrillard]], a [[simulacrum]] is a reproduction of an [[object]] or [[event]] characteristic of a specific stage in the history of the [[image]] or [[sign]].

He traces a series of [[stage]]s in its emergence.

===First Order===
Whereas the [[image]] was once a [[reflection]] of a basic [[reality]], as in the [[feudal order]] in which [[sign]]s were clear indications of hierarchical status, it came to mask or [[pervert]] a basic [[reality]] when, in the baroque period that privileged [[artifice]] and [[counterfeit]] over natural [[sign]]s, arbitrary or artificial [[sign]]s began to proliferate.

Such [[sign]]s are described as first order [[simulacra]].


===Second Order===
With the mass production of industrial objects in [[Benjamin]]'s 'era of mechanical reproduction', second order [[simulacra]] predominated as 'originals' lost their mystic [[aura]].

Such [[simulacra]] signal the [[absence]] of a basic [[reality]].





===Third Order===
The third order [[simulacra]] of [[postmodernity]] have no relation to [[reality]] whatsoever, and are their own pure [[simulacrua]] or imitations of imitations.


===Disneyland Example===
The ultimate [[simulacra]] is Disneyland.

According to [[Baudrillard]], Disneyland is presented as imaginary - or simulates its own imaginary nature - in order to make us believe that the rest of America is real rather than something belonging to the order of [[simulation]] and [[hyperreality]].
