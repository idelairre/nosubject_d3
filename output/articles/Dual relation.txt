==Imaginary Order==
[[Duality]] and [[dual relations]] are essential characteristics of the [[imaginary order]].

==Dyads==
The paradigmatic [[dual relation]] is the relation between the [[ego]] and the [[specular image]] (''a'' ''a''') which [[Lacan]] analyzes in his concept of the [[mirror stage]].

==Symmetry==
The [[dual relation]] is always characterized by [[illusion]]s of similarity, symmetry and reciprocity.

==Symbolic Order==
In contrast to the [[duality]] of the [[imaginary]] [[order]], the [[symbolic]] [[order]] is characterised by [[triad]]s. 

==Triads==
In the [[symbolic]] [[order]] all relations involve not two but three terms; the third term is the [[big Other]], which mediates all [[imaginary]] [[dual relation]]s. 

==Non-Symmetry==
The [[illusion]] of reciprocity in the [[imaginary]] [[dual relation]]ship contrasts with the [[symbolic]], which is the realm of "absolute non-reciprocity."<ref>{{Ec}} p. 774</ref>

==Oedipus Complex==
The [[Oedipus complex]] is the paradigmatic [[triad|triangular]] [[structure]], since the [[father]] is introduced into the [[dual relation]] between [[mother]] and [[child]] as a third term. 

==Structure==
The [[Oedipal]] passage from a [[dual relation]] to a [[triad|triangular]] [[structure]] is none other than the passage from the [[imaginary]] to the [[symbolic]] [[order]]. 

Indeed, the very concept of [[structure]] itself involves a minimum of three terms; "there are always three terms in the structure."<ref>{{S1}} p.218</ref>

=="Imaginary Triad"==
The opposition between [[imaginary]] [[dyad]]s and [[symbolic]] [[triad]]s is complicated by [[Lacan]]'s discussion of the "[[imaginary triad]]."<ref>{{E}} p. 197; {{S4}} p. 29</ref>

The [[imaginary]] [[triad]] is [[Lacan]]'s attempt to theorize the [[preoedipal stage]] in terms other than those of a merely [[dual relation]]ship, and refers to the moment preceding the [[Oedipus complex]], when a third element (the [[imaginary phallus]]) circulates between the [[mother]] and [[infant]]. 

When the [[father]] intervenes in the [[Oedipus complex]] he can therefore be seen either as a third element (between [[mother]] and [[child]]) or as a fourth element (in addition to [[mother]], [[child]] and [[phallus]]).

It is for this reason that [[Lacan]] writes that in the [[Oedipus complex]] "it is not a question of a father-mother-child triangle, but of a triangle (father)-phallus-mother-child."<ref>{{S3}} p.319</ref>

==Psychoanalytic Treatment==
One of [[Lacan]]'s most frequent criticisms of the [[psychoanalytic theory]] of his day is that it constantly fails to theorise the role of the [[symbolic]], and thus reduces the [[psychoanalytic]] encounter to an [[imaginary]] [[dual relation]]ship between [[analyst]] and [[analysand]]. 

In particular, it reduces [[analytic]] [[treatment]] to an [[ego]]-to-[[ego]] encounter which, because of the [[aggressivity]] inherent in all [[imaginary]] [[dual relation]]s, often degenerates into a "[[fight to the death]]" between [[analyst]] and [[analysand]], a power struggle in which they are "at daggers drawn."

==Other==
Against such a misconception, [[Lacan]] insists on the function of the [[symbolic]] in the [[analytic]] process, which introduces the [[Other]] as the third term in the [[analytic]] encounter. 

<blockquote>"It is within a three- rather than two-term relation that we have to formulate the analytic experience."<ref>{{S1}} p. 11</ref></blockquote>

Rather than seeing the [[treatment]] as a power struggle in which the [[analyst]] must overcome the [[patient]]'s [[resistance]], which is not [[psychoanalysis]] but [[suggestion]], the [[analyst]] must realise that both he and the [[patient]] are equally subjected to the power of a third term: [[language]] itself.

==Jacques Lacan==
[[Lacan]]'s rejection of [[duality]] can also be seen in his rejection of all [[dual]]istic schemes of thought in favour of [[triad]]ic schemes.

<blockquote>"All two-sided relationships are always stamped with the style of the imaginary."<ref>{{L}} "[[Works of Jacques Lacan|Fetishism: The Symbolic, the Imaginary and the Real]]" (with W. Granoff), in M. Balint (ed.), ''Perversions: Psychodynamics and Therapy'', New York: Random House, London: Tavistock, 1956b. p. 274</ref></blockquote>

===More Triads===
For example instead of the traditional binary opposition between what is [[real]] and what is [[imaginary]], [[Lacan]] proposes a tripartite model of [[real]], [[imaginary]] and [[symbolic]].

Other such [[triad]]ic schemes are the three [[clinical structures]] of [[neurosis]], [[psychosis]] and [[perversion]]; the three [[formation]]s of the [[ego]] ([[ego-ideal]], [[ideal ego]] and [[superego]]); the [[triad]] [[nature]]-[[culture]]-[[society]]; etc. 

==Quaternary==
However, as if to counteract this trend, [[Lacan]] also emphasised the importance of schemes involving four elements (see [[quaternary]]).
