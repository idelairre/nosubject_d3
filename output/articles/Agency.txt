=====Translator's Note=====
[[Lacan]]'s use of the term "[[agency|instance]]" goes well beyond [[Freud]]'s "[[Agency|Instanz]]".

It represents, one might say, an exploitation of the [[linguistics|linguistic]] possibilities of the [[French]] equivalent of [[Freud]]'s [[German]] term.

In the [[absence]] of any exact equivalent of [[Lacan]]'s [[French]] term, one is thrown back to the term used by [[Freud]]'s [[English]] translators, "[[agency]]".

In [[Freud]], the reference is most often to the three "[[agency|agencies]]" of the [[id]], [[ego]] and [[superego]].

In [[Lacan]], one must bear in mind the idea of an "[[agency|acting upon]]", even "[[agency|insistence]]," as in the title of the essay, "[[The Agency of the Letter in the Unconscious or Reason Since Freud|L'instance de la letter]]".<ref>{{L}} "[[The Agency of the Letter in the Unconscious or Reason Since Freud|L'instance de la lettre dans l'inconscient ou la raison depuis Freud]]." ''[[Écrits]]''. Paris: Seuil, 1966: 493-528 ["[[The Agency of the Letter in the Unconscious or Reason Since Freud|The agency of the letter in the unconscious or reason since Freud]]." Trans. [[Alan Sheridan]] ''[[Écrits: A Selection]]''. London: Tavistock, 1977; New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1977: 146-78]. </ref>
