'''Judith Miller''' (born [[Jacques Lacan:Biography#1921|1941]]) is a [[French]] [[philosopher]], and the daughter of [[Jacques Lacan]] &mdash; radical [[psychoanalyst]], and wife to prominent Lacanian [[Jacques-Alain Miller]].

As a Maoist philosophy lecturer at Vincennes in Paris, her radicalism caused the official disaffiliation of the philosophy department, after she handed out course credit to someone she met on a bus, and subsequently publicly declared in a radio interview that the university is a capitalist institution, and that she would do everything she could to make it run as badly as possible. After this she was demoted by the French education department to a lycée teacher.
