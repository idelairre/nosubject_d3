=====Jacques Lacan=====
=====''Moi'' and ''Je''=====
From [[Works of Jacques Lacan|very early on in his work]], [[Lacan]] plays on the fact that the [[German]] term which [[Freud]] uses (''[[Ego|Ich]]'') can be translated into [[French]] by two words: ''[[ego|moi]]'' (the usual term which [[French]] [[psychoanalyst]]s use for [[Freud]]'s ''[[ego|Ich]]'') and ''[[ego|je]]''. 

Thus, for example, in his paper on the [[mirror stage]], [[Lacan]] oscillates between the two terms.<ref>{{L}} "[[The Mirror Stage as Formative of the Function of the I as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience|Le stade du miroir comme formateur de la fonction du Je]]," in {{Ec}} pp. 93-100 ["[[The Mirror Stage as Formative of the Function of the I as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience]]", trans. [[Alan Sheridan]], in {{E}} pp. 1-7].</ref>

While it is difficult to discern any systematic distinction between the two terms in this paper, it is clear that they are not simply used interchangeably, and in 1956 he is still groping for a way to distinguish clearly between them.<ref>{{S3}} p. 261</ref>

=====Shifter=====
It was the publication of [[Jakobson]]'s paper on [[shifter]]s in 1957 that allowed [[Lacan]] to theorise the distinction more clearly; thus, in 1960, [[Lacan]] refers to the ''[[ego|je]]'' as a [[shifter]], which designates but does not [[signify]] the [[subject]] of the [[enunciation]].<ref>{{E}} p. 298</ref> 

=====Translation=====
Most English translations make [[Lacan]]'s usage clear by rendering ''[[ego|moi]]'' as "[[ego]]" and ''[[ego|je]]'' as "[[ego|I]]".

=====Ego-Psychology=====
When [[Lacan]] uses the Latin term [[ego]] (the term used to translate [[Freud]]'s ''[[ego|Ich]]'' in the [[Standard Edition]]), he uses it in the same sense as the term ''[[moi]]'', but also means it to imply a  more direct reference to Anglo-American [[school]]s of [[psychoanalysis]], especially [[ego-psychology]].

=====Sigmund Freud=====
[[Freud]]'s use of the term ''[[ego|Ich]]'' ([[ego]]) is extremely complex and went through many developments throughout the course of his [[Works of Sigmund Freud|work]] before coming to denote one of the three agencies of the so-called "[[ego|structural model]]" (the others being the [[id]] and the [[superego]]). 

=====Two Approaches=====
Despite the complexity of [[Freud]]'s formulations on the [[ego]], [[Lacan]] discerns two main approaches to the [[ego]] in [[Freud]]'s [[Works of Sigmund Freud|work]], and points out that they are apparently contradictory. 

On the one hand, in the context of the theory of [[narcissism]], "the ego takes sides against the object", whereas on the other hand, in the context of the so-called "[[ego|structural model]]", "the ego takes sides with the object."<ref>{{L}} "[[Works of Jacques Lacan|Some Reflections on the Ego]]," ''Int. J. Psycho-Anal.'', vol. 34, 1953: p. 11</ref> 

The former approach places the [[ego]] firmly in the [[libido|libidinal economy]] and links it with the [[pleasure principle]], whereas the latter approach links the [[ego]] to the perception-consciousness system and opposes it to the [[pleasure principle]]. 

[[Lacan]] claims too that the apparent contradiction between these two accounts "disappears when we free ourselves from a naive conception of the reality-principle."<ref>{{L}} "[[Works of Jacques Lacan|Some Reflections on the Ego]]," ''Int. J. Psycho-Anal.'', vol. 34, 1953: p. 11</ref>

Thus the [[reality]] that the [[ego]] mediates with, in the latter account, is in fact made out of the [[pleasure principle]] which the [[ego]] represents in the former account. 

However, it is arguable whether this argument really resolves the contradiction or whether it does not, in effect, simply privilege the former account at the expense of the latter.

=====Center of the Subject=====
[[Lacan]] argues that [[Freud]]'s discovery of the [[unconscious]] removed the [[ego]] from the central position to which [[philosophy|western philosophy]], at least since [[Descartes]], had traditionally assigned it. 

[[Lacan]] also argues that the proponents of [[ego-psychology]] betrayed [[Freud]]'s radical discovery by relocating the [[ego]] as the center of the [[subject]]. 

In opposition to this [[school|school of thought]], [[Lacan]] maintains that the [[ego]] is not at the center, that the [[ego]] is in fact an [[object]].                '

=====Identification=====
The [[ego]] is a [[formation|construction]] which is formed by [[identification]] with the [[specular image]] in the [[Mirror stage]]. 

=====Alienation=====
It is thus the place where the [[subject]] becomes [[alienate]]d from himself, transforming himself into the [[counterpart]]. 

=====Paranoiac Structure=====
This [[alienation]] on which the [[ego]] is based is [[structure|structurally]] similar to [[paranoia]], which is why [[Lacan]] writes that the [[ego]] has a [[paranoiac]] [[structure]].<ref>{{E}} p. 20</ref> 

=====Imaginary Formation=====
The [[ego]] is thus an [[imaginary]] [[formation]], as opposed to the [[subject]], which is a product of the [[symbolic]].<ref>{{E}} p. 128</ref> 

=====Méconnaissance=====
Indeed, the [[ego]] is precisely a [[méconnaissance]] of the [[symbolic order]], the seat of [[resistance]]. 

=====Symptom=====
The [[ego]] is [[structure]]d like a [[symptom]]:

<blockquote>"The ego is structured exactly like a symptom. At the heart of the subject, it is only a privileged symptom, the human symptom par excellence, the mental illness of man."<ref>{{S1}} p. 16</ref></blockquote>

=====Analytic Treatment=====
[[Lacan]] is therefore totally opposed to the idea, current in [[ego-psychology]], that the [[end of analysis|aim]] of [[psychoanalytic treatment]] is to strengthen the [[ego]]. 

Since the [[ego]] is "the seat of illlusions",<ref>{{S1}} p. 62</ref> to increase its strength would only succeed in increasing the [[subject]]'s [[alienation]]. 

=====Resistance=====
The [[ego]] is also the source of [[resistance]] to [[psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]], and thus to strengthen it would only increase those [[resistance]]s. 

Because of its [[imaginary]] fixity, the [[ego]] is [[resistance|resistant]] to all subjective growth and change, and to the [[dialectic|dialectical movement]] of [[desire]]. 

By undermining the fixity of the [[ego]], [[psychoanalytic treatment]] aims to restore the [[dialectic]] of [[desire]] and reinitiate the [[being|coming-into-being]] of the [[subject]].

=====Adaptation=====
[[Lacan]] is opposed to the [[ego-psychology]] view which takes the [[ego]] of the [[analysand]] to be the ally of the [[analyst]] in the [[treatment]]. 

He also rejects the view that the [[end of analysis|aim]] of [[psychoanalytic treatment]] is to promote the [[adaptation]] of the [[ego]] to [[reality]].
