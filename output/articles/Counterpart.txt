==Jacques Lacan==

This notion of the "[[counterpart|specular ego]]" was first developed in the essay, "[[The Mirror Stage]]".


The term "[[counterpart]]" plays an important part in [[Lacan]]'s [[Works of Jacques Lacan|work]] from the 1930s on, and designates other people in whom the [[subject]] perceives a likeness to himself (principally a visual likeness).

The [[counterpart]] plays an important part in the [[intrusion complex]] and in the [[mirror stage]] (which are themselves closely related.

==Intrusion Complex==
The [[intrusion complex]] is one of the three "[[family]] [[complex|complexes]]" which [[Lacan]] discusses in his 1938 article on the [[family]], and arises when the [[child]] first realizes that he has siblings, that other [[subject]]s ''like him'' participate in the [[family]] [[structure]].

The emphasis here is on likeness; the [[child]] [[identification|identifies]] with his siblings on the basis of the recognition of bodily similarity (which depends, of course, on their being a relatively small age difference between the [[subject]] and his siblings).

=="Imago of the Counterpart"==
It is this [[identification]] that gives rise to the "[[counterpart|imago of the counterpart]]."<ref>{{L}} ''[[Works of Jacques Lacan|Les complexes familiaux dans la formation de l'individu. Essai d'analyse d'une fonction en psychologie]]'', Paris: Navarin, 1984. p. 35-9</ref>

The [[imago]] of the [[counterpart]] is interchangeable with the [[image]] of the [[subject]]'s own [[body]], the [[specular image]] with which the [[subject]] [[identifies]] in the [[mirror stage]], leading to the [[formation]] of the [[ego]]. 

==Formation of the Ego==
This interchangeability is evident in such phenomena as [[transitivism]], and illustrates the way that the [[subject]] constitutes his [[object]]s on the basis of his [[ego]]. 

The [[image]] of another person's [[body]] can only be [[identified]] with insofar as it is perceived as similar to one's own [[body]], and conversely the [[counterpart]] is only recognised as a [[separate]], [[identifiable]] [[ego]] by [[projection|projecting]] one's own [[ego]] onto him.

=="Littler Other"==
In 1955 [[Lacan]] introduces a distinction between the "[[big Other]]" and the "[[little other]]" -- or the "[[imaginary other]]" -- reserving the latter term for the [[counterpart]] and/or [[specular image]]. 

The [[counterpart]] is the [[little other]] because it is not truly [[other]] at all; it is not the radical [[alterity]] represented by the [[Other]], but the [[other]] insofar as he is similar to the [[ego]].
