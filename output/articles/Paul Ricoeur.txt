'''Paul Ricœur''' ([[February 27]], [[1913]], [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] – [[May 20]], [[2005]], [[Chatenay Malabry]]) was a [[French people|French]] [[philosopher]]  best known for combining [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] description with [[hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] interpretation.  As such, he is connected to two other major hermeneutic phenomenologists, [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]].

Ricœur's early years were marked by two main facts. First, he was born to a devout [[Protestant]] family, making him a member of a religious minority in [[Catholic]] [[France]]. Second, his father died in [[WWI]] in 1915, when Ricoeur was only two years old. As a result he was raised by his Aunt in [[Rennes]] with a small [[stipend]] afforded to him as a war orphan. Ricœur was a bookish, intellectually precocious boy whose penchant for study was increased by his family's Protestant emphasis on Bible study. Ricœur received his ''license'' in [[1933]] from the [[University of Rennes]] and began studying philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1934, where he was influenced by [[Gabriel Marcel]]. In [[1935]] he [[agrégation| agrégated]] second in the nation, presaging a bright future despite his provincial origins.

[[World War II|WWII]] interrupted Ricœur's career, and he was drafted to serve in the French army in 1939. His unit was captured during the German invasion of France in 1940 and he spent the next five years as a prisoner of war. His detention camp was filled with other intellectuals such as [[Mikel Dufrenne]] who organized readings and classes sufficiently rigorous that the camp was accredited as a degree-granting institution by the [[Vichy]] government. During this time he read [[Karl Jaspers]], who was to have a great influence on him. He also began a translation of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s ''Ideas I''.

After the war Ricœur took up a position at the [[University of Strasbourg]] ([[1948]]-[[1956]]). In [[1950]] he received his doctorate submitting (as is customary in France) two theses: a 'minor' thesis which was a translation and commentary on Husserl's ''Ideas I'' (the first available in French) and a 'major' thesis that would later be published as ''Le Volontaire et l'Involontaire''. As a result of his scholarly work, Ricœur earned a reputation as an expert in [[phenomenology]], whose popularity in France had begun during the 1930s and increased during and after the war.

In [[1956]] Ricœur took up a position at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] as the Chair of General Philosophy. This appointment signaled Ricœur's rise as one of France's most prominent philosophers. During this time he wrote ''Fallible Man'' and ''The Symbolism of Evil'' published in 1960, and ''Freud and Philosophy: Essays on Interpretation'' published in 1965.  These works cemented his reputation.

From [[1965]] to [[1970]] Ricœur took up a position at the newly founded [[University of Nanterre]]. Nanterre was an experiment in progressive education and Ricœur hoped it would allow him the opportunity to escape the stifling atmosphere of the tradition-bound Sorbonne and its over-crowded classes and create a university in accordance with his vision. Unfortunately, Nanterre become a hot bed of protest during the student uprisings of [[May 1968]] and Ricœur was derided as an 'old clown' and tool of the French government. 

At the nadir of his popularity and disenchanted with life in France, Ricœur taught at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium and also took a position at the [[University of Chicago]] in [[1970]] where he would remain until [[1985]]. As a result Ricœur became acquainted with American philosophy and social science, making him one of the few thinkers equally at home with the French, German, and English-language intellectual scenes. The results were two of Ricœur's most important and enduring works: ''The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning of Language'' published in 1975 and the three-volume ''Time and Narrative'' published in 1984, 1985, and 1988.  Building on the discussion of narrative identity, as well as Ricœur's continuing interest in the self, Ricœur presented the Gifford Lectures, which resulted in the important work "Oneself as Another" published in 1992.  

With ''Time and Narrative'' Ricœur returned to France as an intellectual superstar. His late work was characterised by a continuous cross-cutting of national intellectual traditions, and some of his latest writing engaged the thought of the American political philosopher [[John Rawls]].

On November 29, 2004, he was awarded with the second [[Kluge Prize|John W. Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Human Sciences]] (shared with [[Jaroslav Pelikan]]).

Paul Ricœur died the 20th May 2005 in his house in Chatenay Malabry, west of Paris, during sleep by natural causes. French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin declared that "the humanist European tradition is in mourning for one of his most talented exponents".
