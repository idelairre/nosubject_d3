'''Roger Caillois''' ([[March 3]], [[1913]] - [[December 21]], [[1978]]), was a French [[intellectual]] whose idiosyncratic work brought together [[literary criticism]], [[sociology]], and [[philosophy]] by focusing on subjects as diverse as [[gem]]s and the [[sacred]]. He was also instrumental in introducing Latin American authors to the French public.

Caillois was born in [[Reims]] but moved to [[Paris]] as a child. There he studied at the prestigious [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]], an elite school where students took courses after graduating from secondary school in order to prepare for examinations for a top spot at university. Caillois's efforts paid off and he entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]], graduating in [[1933]]. After this he studied at the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]] where he came into contact with thinkers such as [[Georges Dumézil]], [[Alexandre Kojève]], and [[Marcel Mauss]]. 

The years before the war were marked by Caillois's increasingly leftist political commitment, particularly in his fight against fascism. He was also engaged in Paris's avant-garde intellectual life. With [[Georges Bataille]] he founded the [[College of Sociology]], a group of intellectuals who lectured regularly to one another. Formed partly as a reaction to the [[Surrealist]] movement that was dominant in the 1920s, the College sought to move away from surrealism's focus on the fantasy life of an individual's unconscious and focus instead more on the power of ritual and other aspects of communal life. Caillois's background in [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]], and particularly his interest in the sacred, exemplified this approach.

Caillois left France in [[1939]] for Argentina, where he stayed until the end of [[World War II|WWII]]. During the war he was active in fighting the spread of Nazism in Latin America as an editor and author of anti-Nazi periodicals. In [[1948]], after the war, he worked with [[UNESCO]] and traveled widely. In 1971 he was elected to the [[Académie Française]].

Today Caillois is remembered for founding and editing ''Diogenes'', an interdisciplinary journal funded by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]], and ''Southern Cross'', a translation of contemporary Latin American authors published by [[Gallimard]] that is responsible for introducing authors such as [[Borges|J.L. Borges]] or [[Alejo Carpentier]] to the French-speaking public.
