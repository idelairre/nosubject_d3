An opposition introduced by [[Saussure]] to describe two aspects of [[language]] and two contrasting approaches to [[linguistics]].
The synchronic approach studies the state of a [[language]] at a given stage of its [[evolution]] and facilitates the analysis of the system of internal relations that constitutes it as a [[language]].
THe diachronic approach typical of [[philology]] traces the historical evolution of a [[language]] through time by recording the changes that have taken place in it.
Most schools of mdoern [[linguistics]] can be described as synchronic.
