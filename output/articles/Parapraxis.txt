In [[psychoanalytic theory]], a [[bungled action]] such as a [[slip of the tongue]] whose goal is not achieved and which is replaced by another.

Like [[symptom]]s, [[parapraxes]] are [[interpret]]ed by [[Freud]] as [[compromise formation]]s resulting from a [[conflict]] between [[conscious]] [[intentions]] and [[repressed]] [[feeling]]s or impulses.

A [[parapraxis]] is an [[act]] that appears to be [[unintentional]] but can be [[understood]], through [[psychoanalytic]] exploration, to be perfectly motivated and [[unconscious]]ly determined. 

A brief and delimited [[disturbance]] that may be spontaneously explained as the result of chance or inattention, a [[parapraxis]] may be readily perceived by its initiator or by a third party to be a "mistake."

[[Parapraxes]] include a wide range of events, including failures of [[memory]], slips of the tongue or pen, [[mistake]]s, and [[bungled]] or accidental acts. 

A [[parapraxis]] cannot be explained by referring to the nature of the "[[slip]]" itself, but [[psychoanalytic]] hypotheses make it possible for it to be described simultaneously as a [[mistake]] and not a [[mistake]], depending on one's point of view.

[[Parapraxes]] interested [[Freud]] as early as 1890. 

In letters to [[Wilhelm Fliess]], he created a virtual collection of examples communicated to him by correspondents. 

[[Parapraxes]] represented, in fact, an important demonstration of [[disturbance]]s created by the [[unconscious]]. 

As opposed to [[dream]]s, [[parapraxes]] tend to require fewer biographical details while providing valuable evidence—indeed, often with comical effect—that offers a popular audience an easy way to grasp [[psychoanalysis]]. 

Furthermore, [[parapraxes]] constitute one of the pillars of the [[psychopathology]] of everyday [[life]], which [[Freud]] considered necessary to understand [[mental]] [[pathology]] in a broader context.

[[Freud]] discusses [[parapraxes]] in two of his major works: [[Psychopathology of Everyday Life]] (1901) and [[Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis]] (1915-17).

Beyond the anecdotal nature of many of the examples in these two works, [[parapraxes]] clearly raise an issue fundamental for [[psychoanalytic]] [[thought]]—namely, the link between [[psychic]] [[determinism]] and the [[unconscious]]. 

[[Freud]] was led to clarify his position toward the notion of "chance" as differentiated from [[superstition]]: 

<blockquote>"I do not believe that an event in whose occurrence my mental life plays no part can teach me any hidden thing about the future shape of reality; but I believe that an unintentional manifestation of my own mental activity does on the other hand disclose something hidden, though again it is something that belongs only to my mental life [not to external reality]. I believe in external (real) chance, it is true, but not in internal (psychical) accidental events."<ref>Freud, 1901b, p328</ref></blockquote>


The link between [[parapraxes]] and [[psychopathology]], moreover, is established, according to [[Freud]], uniquely through the fact that, in the case of [[chance]] [[event]]s in a real world, "slips" involve the most insignificant [[psychic]] [[event]]s. 

By contrast, [[neurotic]] [[symptom]]s are related to the most important [[psychic]] functions from both [[individual]] and [[social]] perspectives. 

In both instances, however, the same processes enable such [[symptom]]s to be understood, that is, as compromise [[formation]]s located between [[desire]] and [[defense]], between a [[subject]]'s [[conscious]] [[intention]] and [[repression]].
