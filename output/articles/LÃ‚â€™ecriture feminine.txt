L’ecriture feminine 
(Tong, 211) is a term from Helene Cixous’ "The Laugh of the Medusa."  Women must learn to “write their bodies”, theory that language and sexuality are intimately connected, women have been alienated by male language.  Cixous declares that “if women dare to write out of their bodily sexual, unconscious experiences unique to them as women, the result will be not only personally liberating but will have the power to smash the very structure of patriarchy” (Tuttle, Lisa. Encyclopedia of Feminism, Facts on File Publications, NY, 1986).
