=====Book Description=====
[[Image:ContingencyHegemonyUniversality.jpg|200px|thumb|Book Cover]]
In a compelling and unusual experiment, three eminent theorists engage in a dialogue on central questions of contemporary philosophy and politics. Their essays, organized as separate contributions that respond to one another, range over the Hegelian legacy in contemporary critical theory, the theoretical dilemmas of multiculturalism, the universalism- versus-particularism debate, the strategies of the Left in a globalized economy, and the relative merits of post-structumalism and Lacanian psychoanalysis for a critical social theory.

While the rigour and intelligence with which these writers approach their work is formidable, ''Contingency, Hegemony, Universality'' benefits additionally from their clear sense of energy and enjoyment in a revealing and often unpredictable exchange.
