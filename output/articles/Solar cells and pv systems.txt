Solar cells are created of a panel of silicon or a similar chemical attached to wires along with a battery. Solar cells are materials that turn sunlight into electrical energy. Solar cells currently supply less than 0. Solar cells are a clean and reliable approach of generating electrical energy.

[http://www.solar-energy.co.uk Photovoltaics] are an ideal choice for sustainable communities simply because the technologies is environmentally compatible, decentralized, and avoids reliance on centrally controlled resources, but photovoltaic installations are costly.

I would like to thank the committee for providing me the opportunity to testify and deeply appreciate your interest in supporting the emerging power technologies development and commercial deployment.

PV technologies was initial applied in space, by providing electricity to satellites. Large-scale PV systems of a lot more than 1 megawatt have a 10 % share in the marketplace, and they normally comprise ground-mounted systems in the open countryside. Table 1 contains the voltage and present of a PV module as the load is varied from near a short circuit (zero resistance) to near the open circuit (infinite resistance).
