==Freudian Dictionary==


<blockquote>When someone talks of the subconscious, I do not know whether he means it topographically, as what lies in the psyche below consciousness, or qualitatively, as another consciousness-a subterranean one as it were. Probably he is not clear on the point himself. The only admissible antithesis is between conscious and unconscious. But it would be a serious error to suppose that this distinction coincides with that between the Ego and the Id.<ref>{{QLA}} Ch. 2</ref></blockquote>
