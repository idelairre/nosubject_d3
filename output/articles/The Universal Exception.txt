=====Book Description=====
[[Image:The.Universal.Exception.jpg|200px|thumb|Book Cover]]
"The most formidably brilliant exponent of psychoanalysis, indeed of cultural theory in general, to have emerged from europe in some decades." -  Terry Eagleton

'One of the most innovative and exciting contemporary thinkers of the left.' TLS

The Universal Exception is the second volume of the collected key writings of Slavoj Zizek - one of the most provocative and inspiring writers on culture at work today. Collecting together a broad selection of Zizek's major writings on politics, The Universal Exception showcases Zizek's formidable range of interests and his style. The book includes his writings on such right-wing icons as Ayn Rand and Leni Riefenstahl; his take on the logic of capitalism and the condition of contemporary radical politics; and his views on major current global issues and events, including the Iraq war. Together with Interrogating the Real, the first volume of Zizek's selected writings, this collection offers a superb introduction to the work of this prolific, controversial and vastly entertaining cultural commentator.
