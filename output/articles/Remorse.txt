<blockquote>Remorse is a general term denoting the ego's reaction under a special form of the sense of guilt; it includes the almost unaltered sensory material belonging to the anxiety that is at work behind the sense of guilt; it is itself a punishment; it too, therefore, may occur before conscience has developed.<ref>{{C&D}} Ch. 8</ref></blockquote>
