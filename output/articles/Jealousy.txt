<blockquote>Jealousy is one of those affective states, like grief, that may be described as normal. If anyone appears to be without it, the inference is justified that it has undergone severe repression and consequently plays all the greater part in his unconscious mental life. The instances of abnormally intense jealousy met with in analytic work reveal themselves as constructed of three layers. The three layers or stages of jealousy may be described as (1) competitive or normal, (2) projected, and (3) delusional jealousy.<ref>{{NM-JPH}}</ref></blockquote>
