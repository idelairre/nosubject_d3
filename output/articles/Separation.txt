[[Lacan]] introduced the concept of "[[separation]]" in [[Seminar XI]].<ref>{{S11}}</ref>

"[[Separation]]" is linked to [[desire]], and designates the process through which the [[child]] differentiates himself from the [[mother]] and is not simply a [[subject]] of [[language]].

[[Separation]] occurs in the domain of [[desire]] and requires from the [[subject]] a "[[want-to-be]]" (''manque-à-être'') separate from the [[signifying chain]].

It also involves a "want to know" of that which is outside [[structure]] and beyond [[language]] and the [[Other]].
