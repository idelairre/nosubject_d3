=====Linguistic Definition=====
"[[Metalanguage]]" is the technical [[linguistic]] term for any form of [[language]] which is used to describe or analyze the properties of another [[language]].

=====Roman Jakobson=====
[[Roman Jakobson]] includes the metalingual function in his list of the functions of [[language]].<ref>[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson, Roman]]. "Linguistics and poetics," in ''Selected Writings'', vol. II, ''Poetry of Grammar and Grammar of Poetry'', The Hague: Mouton, 1981 [1960]., p. 25</ref>

=====Jacques Lacan=====
=====Early Work=====
[[Lacan]]'s first reference to [[metalanguage]] comes in 1956, when he echoes [[Jakobson]]'s view on the metalingual function of all [[language]]:

<blockquote>"All [[language]] implies a [[metalanguage]], its already a [[metalanguage]] of its own register."<ref>{{S3}} p. 226</ref></blockquote>

=====Later Work=====
A few years later, in 1960, he says precisely the opposite, arguing that "no [[metalanguage]] can be spoken."<ref>{{E}} p.311</ref>

=====No "Outside" of Language=====
What [[Lacan]] appears to mean by this remark is that, since every attempt to fix the [[signification|meaning]] of [[language]] must be done in [[language]], there can be no escape from [[language]], no "outside".

This is reminiscent of [[Heidegger]]'s views on the impossibility of exiting "the house of language."

=====Metalanguage Does Not Exist=====
[[Lacan]] rejects the very possibility of a [[metalanguage|metalinguistic dimension]], denies the [[existence]] of any [[metalanguage]].

[[Lacan]] follows [[Heidegger]]'s view of [[language]] as a "house of being" of which it is impossible to step [[outside]].

=====Meaning Beyond Language=====
This also appears similar to the [[structuralism|structuralist]] theme of ''il n'y a rien hors du texte'' ("there is nothing outside the text"), but it is not the same; [[Lacan]] does not deny that there is a beyond of [[language]] (this beyond is the [[real]]), but he does argue that this beyond is not of a kind that could finally anchor [[signification|meaning]].

There is, in other words, no transcendental [[signified]], no way that [[language]] could "tell the truth about truth."<ref>{{Ec}} p. 867-8</ref>

=====No Other of the Other=====
The same point is also expressed in the phrase: 

<blockquote>"There is no Other of the Other."<ref>{{E}} p. 311</ref></blockquote>

If the [[Other]] is the guarantee of the coherence of the [[subject]]'s [[discourse]], then the falsity of this guarantee is revealed by the fact that the guarantor himself lacks such a guarantee.

=====Transference=====
In a clinical context, this means that there is no [[metalanguage]] of the [[transference]], no point outside the [[transference]] from which it could be finally [[interpretation|interpreted]] and "liquidated."
