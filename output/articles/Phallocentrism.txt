====The Primacy of the Phallus====
[[Lacan]] has often been accused of "[[phallocentrism]]."  And it is true that he has asserted that "the phallus is the privileged signifier."<ref>?</ref>

====The Distinction between Phallus and Penis====
The meaning of the term [[phallus]], however, has often been misunderstood.  The term [[phallus]] must be distinguished from the term [[penis]].  The [[penis]] is an [[organ]] of the [[body]], but least of all an [[organ]], a [[penis]].  The [[phallus]] symbolizes the [[penis]] and the clitoris.  It is a [[signifier]].  In short, [[Lacan]]'s distinction between the [[penis]] and the [[phallus]] enables [[Freud]]'s [[biology|biologistic account]] of male superiority and [[women]]'s [[penis-envy]] to be explained in [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[symbolic]], and thus historical terms.
