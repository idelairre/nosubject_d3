| [[French]]: [[quilting point|point de capiton{{Bottom}}

The [[French]] term ''[[point de capiton]]'' is variously translated in [[English]] editions of [[Lacan]]'s work as "[[quilting point]]" or "[[anchoring point]]."  To avoid the confusion resulting from this variety of translation, the term has here been left in the original [[French]]. 

=====Upholstery Button=====
It literally designates an [[upholstery button]], the analogy being that just as [[upholstery button]]s are places where "the mattress-maker's needle has worked hard to prevent a shapeless mass of stuffing from moving too freely about.<ref>Bowie, Malcolm. (1991) ''Lacan'', London: Fontana. p.74</ref>," so the ''[[points de capiton]]'' are points at which the "signified and signifier are knotted together."<ref>{{S3}} p. 268</ref>

=====Slippage=====
[[Lacan]] introduces the term in his 1955-6 [[seminar]] on [[the psychoses]] to account for the fact that despite the continual [[slip]]page of the [[signified]] under the [[signifier]], there are nevertheless in the normal ([[neurotic]]) [[subject]] certain fundamental "attachment points" between the [[signified]] and the [[signifier]] where this [[slip]]page is temporarily halted.  A certain minimum number of these points are "necessary for a person to be called normal," and "when they are not established, or when they give way'" the result is [[psychosis]].<ref>{{S3}} pp. 268-9</ref> This helps to explain how it is that in the [[psychotic]] experience, "the signifier and the signified present themselves in a completely divided form."<ref>{{S3}} p. 268</ref>.

=====Illusion of a Fixed Meaning=====
The ''[[point de capiton]]'' is thus the point in the [[signifying chain]] at which "the signifier stops the otherwise endless movement of the signification" and produces the necessary [[illusion]] of a fixed [[meaning]].<ref>{{E}} p. 303</ref>

=====Diachronic and Synchronic Dimension=====
Since the [[signifying chain]] has both a [[diachronic]] and a [[synchronic]] dimension, so also does the ''[[point de capiton]]'':

=====Diachronic Dimension=====
[[Image:GRAPHOFDESIRE-ONE.jpg|thumb|right|[[graph of desire|The elementary cell]]]]
The [[diachronic]] dimension of the ''[[point de capiton]]'' lies in the fact that [[communication]] is always a [[retroactive]] effect of [[punctuation]].  It is only when the sentence is completed that the sense of the first words is determined [[retroactively]].  This function is illustrated in the [[graph of desire|elementary cell]] of the [[graph of desire]], in which the ''[[point de capiton]]'' is the leftmost point of intersection between the vector '''S - S'''' and the vector.

=====Synchronic Dimension=====
The [[synchronic]] aspect is [[metaphor]], by which the [[signifier]] crosses the [[bar]] into the [[signified]]. 

<blockquote>"The [[synchronic]] [[structure]] (of the ''[[point de capiton]]'') is more hidden, and it is this [[structure]] that takes us to the source. It is [[metaphor]]."<ref>{{E}} p.303</ref></blockquote>

<!-- But if each signification refers to another signification, and that signification refers to another one, in an endless chain, how do we decide what words mean?  The Lacanian term point de capiton (literally, an upholstery stud) refers to a point of convergence.  Just as an upholstery stud or button is the center for the converging lines or creases on the surface of a taut fabric, so the linguistic ''point de capiton'' provides a vantage point from which everything that happens in a given discourse can be situated both retroactively and prospectively. The subject attaches significance to certain signifier; these signifiers, like upholstery buttons, pin down the floating mass of [[signification]].  Lacan stresses the fact that we do not understand a sentence until we know we have reached the end; its meaning remains in suspense until the closure.  A point de capiton, then, is the "anchoring point" by which the signifier stops the otherwise endless movement of signification.  Its diachronic function is to put a halt to the otherwise endless process whereby signifier refers to signifier. -->
