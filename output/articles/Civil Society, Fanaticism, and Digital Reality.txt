</p><p><i><b>Editors' Note: Slavoj</b> Zizek, a leading intellectual in the new 
social movements of Eastern and Central Europe, is a researcher at the Institute 
of Sociology at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. He is the author of 
numerous books including </i>Looking Away: An Introduction to Jacques Lacan 
Through Popular Culture<i>. Zizek also ran as a pro-reform candidate for the 
presidency of the republic of Slovenia, then part of Yugoslavia, in 1990.</i> 
</p><p><b>CTHEORY:</b> Let's speak about the role of intellectuals. Before 1989, 
there was a strange relationship among intellectuals and those in power in 
Eastern Europe. Both bureaucrats and dissidents had some sort of relationship 
with politics. Even now, this is partly the case. In Western Europe this 
phenomenon disappeared and it is hard to see any relationship or even dialogue. 
What should be the role of intellectuals? 
</p><p><b>Zizek:</b> Partially this is true. For me what was partially so 
attractive, so sympathetic about real socialism, despite being a corrupt, 
cynical system, was the belief in the power of the spoken word. Some twenty 
years ago, I was editor of a small art-theoretical journal with a circulation of 
3,400. Once we published a small, obscure poem, incomprehensibly modern, but 
between the lines there was a dissident message. If the power would have ignored 
the poem, nothing would have happened. But there was an extraordinary session of 
the Central Committee. Okay, this is repression, but what I like about it is 
that the communist power took the potential, detonating force of the spoken word 
very seriously. They were always interested in arguing with intellectuals. Let's 
take an artist like Tarkovski, who was half dissident. He was half allowed to 
work, even if they suppressed some of his films. They were impressed, they 
bothered. Fredric Jameson made a nice point about this: we are only now becoming 
aware that what we liked about East-European dissidents like Havel is only 
possible within a socialist system. 

</p><p>Our influence, beginning in the mid-eighties, was at that time incredibly 
large, especially the philosophers, sociologists, literary theoreticians. But 
this was a very limited conjunction. Now there is the pure ignorance of the 
regime, which is simply not interested in ideological questions. I feel sorry 
for those countries in which writers nowadays play an important role. Take 
Serbia, where this nationalist madness was fabricated by writers. Even in 
Slovenia it's the same with the nationalist writers, although they do not have 
much influence. 
</p><p><b>CTHEORY:</b> But you are involved in politics yourself, up until this 
moment. There are a lot of controversies in Ljubljiana about your involvement in 
the governing party and the fact that you write speeches for them. 
</p><p><b>Zizek:</b> There is a messianic complex with intellectuals in Eastern 
Europe. Nothing against it, but it becomes extremely dangerous in Slovenia when 
this messianic vision of intellectuals is combined with a vulgar 
anti-Americanism, which is a very popular political attitude of right wingers. 
America for them means no national solidarity, filthy liberalism, 
multi-culturalism, individualism, the market. They are afraid of a pluralistic 
democracy and there is a proto-fascistic potential in it. This combination of 
nationalist writers, whose obsession is how to retain national identity, and an 
anti-capitalist right-wing movement is very dangerous. 
</p><p>I did something for which I lost almost all my friends, what no good leftist 
ever does: I fully supported the ruling party in Slovenia. For this all my 
leftist friends hate me and of course the whole right wing. What the liberal 
democratic party did was a miracle. Five years ago we were the remainder of the 
new social movements, like feminist and ecological groups. At that time 
everybody thought that we would be vanishing mediators. We made some slyly 
corrupted, but good moves and now we are the strongest party. I think it was our 
party that saved Slovenia from the fate of the other former Yugoslav republics, 
where they have the one-party model. Either right wing like in Croatia or left 
wing like in Serbia, which hegemonized in the name of the national interest. 
With us it's a really diverse, pluralist scene, open towards foreigners (of 
course there are some critical cases). But the changes of a genuine pluralist 
society are not yet lost. 
</p><p>It's typical that this position triggers an enormous hatred against me. 
Slovene media absolutely ignore me, there is never an article about me. On the 
other hand, if some nationalist poet publishes a small poem in some obscure 
Austrian journal, it's a big success in Slovenia. I am rather perceived as some 
dark, ominous, plotting, political manipulator, a role I enjoy immensely and 
like very much. 
</p><p><b>CTHEORY:</b> You have not become cynical about the current power struggles 
you are involved in? 
</p><p><b>Zizek:</b> You do not hear me not saying that it is so disgusting. It's a 
simple, professional choice. Now politics is becoming business-as-usual in 
Slovenia. It's no longer that once a week you write a heroic article and you are 
a hero. It means intrigues and meetings. I simply had to choose. Do I do serious 
theory or politics? What I hate most are the beautiful souls of the left wing 
who complain about their losses, that everything is corrupted, where are the 
good old days of the original, left-wing dissidence? No, you must accept the 
rules of the game. Svetlana Slapzak (from Belgrade, now Ljubljana - GL) and the 
group around her present themselves as marginalized victims. But her groups 
control two departments and the most powerful publishing house. They get the 
most money from the ministry of science. And via the Soros Foundation they are 
selling the story of being surrounded by nationalism. 
</p><p>Let's take me. I was blocked from the university before; I was only teaching 
abroad, in France and in America. I never taught at any university in Slovenia, 
I am absolutely alone, without any research assistant. They just give me enough 
money in order to survive. My answer to Svetlana Slapzak would be: why did she 
become a Slovenian citizen? Her very position is a contradiction of what she 
says. In a state of less than 2 million we offered 100,000 non-Slovenians 
permanent citizenship, against terrible nationalistic resistance. There were no 
dirty tricks involved, like a test if you knew Slovenian. We are still in an 
intermediate stage. When a new political logic imposes itself, the 
<i>Sittlichkeit</i>, the unwritten rules are still unsure, people are still 
searching for a model. The question is: will we become just another small, 
stupid, nationalistic state or maintain this elementary, pluralistic opening? 
And all compromises are worth it for this goal. 

</p><p><b>CTHEORY:</b> What is your view on the work of the Soros Foundation and the 
concept of an "open society"? 
</p><p><b>Zizek:</b> If you look into my heart, you'll see I am an old-fashioned 
left-winger. In the short term I support it, but I don't have Popper notions 
about it. Soros is doing good work in the field of education, refugees and 
keeping the theoretical and social sciences spirit alive. These countries are 
not only impoverished, but the sphere of social sciences is hegemonized by 
Heideggerian nationalists. But the Soros people have this ethic of the bad state 
vs. good civic, independent structures. But sorry, in Slovenia I am for the 
state and against civil society! In Slovenia, civil society is equal to the 
right wingers. In America, after the Oklahoma bombing, they suddenly discovered 
that madmen are everywhere. Civil society is not this nice, social movement, but 
a network of moral majority, conservatives and nationalist pressure groups, 
against abortion, [for] religious education in schools. A real pressure from 
below. 
</p><p>For me the open society means something very practical: the unwritten rules 
of the political space. For example, if you oppose the present government or the 
hegemonic party, are you then still accepted or is there an unwritten, unspoken 
stigma that you are a half-nationalist traitor and so on? Up to what extent can 
you make a career without making political compromises? I don't have any 
fundamental hopes in a socialist revolution or whatever. We have several big 
crises coming: the ecological, the developed against the underdeveloped world 
and the loss of the sense of reality in the face of all the rapid changes. I 
don't underestimate the social impact of the loss of stability. Is the frame of 
liberal capitalism able to solve this antagonism? Unfortunately my answer is no. 
Here I am the old-fashioned left-wing pessimist. I think that ghettoisation, 
like half of L.A., is far stronger than the Marxist class struggle. At least 
both workers and capitalists still participated in legality and the state, 
whereas liberal capitalism simply doesn't integrate the new ghettoes. Liberal 
democracy has no answer to these problems. 
</p><p>A lot of times, this Soros approach of openness indulges in its own species 
of covered racism. Recently at a conference in Amsterdam, Press Now asked 
whether it was possible to find a universal language so that intellectuals from 
various parts of the former Yugoslavia could start a dialogue. I find this 
clich√© extremely dangerous, because it comes from an idea of the Balkans as the 
phantasmatic space of nationalistic madness. This phantasy is very well 
manipulated and expressed in some popular works of art, like Kusturica's film 
<cite>Underground</cite>. He said himself, in <cite>Cahiers du Cinema</cite>, 
that in the Balkans, war is a natural phenomenon, nobody knows when it will 
emerge, it just comes, it's in our genes. This naturalisation of the Balkans 
into an apolitical, primordial theatre of passions is clich√© and I find it very 
suspicious. I would like to quote Hegel here: "The true evil is an attitude 
which perceives evil everywhere." I am very suspicious about this apparent 
multi-cultural, neutral, liberal attitude, which only sees nationalistic madness 
around itself. It posits itself in a witness role. The post-Yugoslav war is 
strictly the result of European cultural dynamics. We don't need this simplistic 
liberal deploring of "why don't people speak to each other?" Nobody is doing 
power analysis. 
</p><p>A common Western clich√© is the so-called complexity of the Balkans. This 
specifically allows the West to maintain its position as an excluded observer. 
What you should do is what I call a phenomenological <i>reduction a 
l'envers</i>. You should not try to understand it. Like TV, the funny effect 
when you disconnect the voice, you only have these stupid gestures. Cut off the 
meaning and then you'll get the pure power battle. The Balkans are a symptom of 
Europe in the sense that it embodies all that is wrong in the light of the 
utopian notion of the European Community itself. What is the dream? A kind of 
neutral, purely technocratic Brussels bureaucracy. They project their mirror 
image on the Balkans. What they both have in common is the exclusion of the 
proper political antagonisms. 
</p><p><b>CTHEORY:</b> The campaign in Holland, Press Now, supports so-called 
independent media in the former Yugoslavia. One of its premises is the idea that 
the war started with propaganda from above through state-controlled media. 
Seeing that any Western intervention already came too late, it states that, for 
example, through independent media, one could work on a long-term solution. Do 
you agree with this analysis? 

</p><p><b>Zizek:</b> Up to a point I agree with this, but I have always been in 
favour of military intervention from the West. Around 1992, with a little bit of 
pressure, the war would have been over. But they missed the moment. Now, with 
the shift of balance and the stronger Russia, this is no longer possible. At 
that time, Croatians and Slovenians were in favour of independence, and the 
Bosnians were much more ambiguous and they are paying the price for it. The 
Bosnians didn't want to prepare for war, they were slower, more careful and 
that's why they are now so mad at the West. There was no protection of Bosnia 
from the Yugoslav army, despite all the guarantees. And then, after the attack, 
the West suddenly started talking about ethnic struggles, all sides must be 
guilty, and primordial passions. 
</p><p>I don't cry too much for Yugoslavia. The moment Milosevic took over and 
annexed Kosovo and Vojvodina, the balance of power shifted. There was the choice 
between a more federal Yugoslavia and a new, centralist one. Do not overestimate 
the role of the media in the late eighties. Media were allowed to play this role 
in order for local communist bureaucracies to survive. The key to the Yugoslav 
crisis is Milosevic's strategy to maintain the power of the old 
<i>nomenclatura</i> by raking up this national question. The media did their 
dirty work. It was horrible to watch day by day the stories in Slovenia about 
Serbs raping us and in Serbia about Albanians raping them. All the news was 
filtered through this poisoning hatred, from everyday crime to economics. But 
this was not the origin of the conflict. That was the calculation from the power 
elite to maintain power. 
</p><p>If you define independence in terms of not being supported or controlled by 
the state, then the worst right-wing weekly is an independent medium and should 
be supported by Soros. I do admit that in Serbia and Croatia there is absolute 
control over the media. What they allow are really small, marginalized media. 
Impartial, independent information can help a lot, but don't expect too much of 
it. 
</p><p><b>CTHEORY:</b> In your speech during the Ars Electronica conference, you 
emphasized the fact that after a phase of introduction, the seduction of the new 
media will be over and so will "virtual sex." So the desire to be wired will be 
over soon? 
</p><p><b>Zizek:</b> The so-called "virtual communities" are not such a great 
revolution as it might appear. What impresses me is the extent to which these 
virtual phenomena retroactively enable us to discover to what extent our self 
has always been virtual. Even the most physical self-experience has a symbolic, 
virtual element in it. For example playing sex games. What fascinates me is that 
the possibility of satisfaction already counts as an actual satisfaction. A lot 
of my friends used to play sex games on Minitel in France. They told me that the 
point is not really to meet a person, not even to masturbate, but that just 
typing your phantasies is the fascination itself. In the symbolic order the 
potentiality already gives actual satisfaction. In psychoanalytic theory the 
notion of symbolic castration is often misunderstood. The threat of castration 
as to its effects, acts as a castration. Or in power relations, where the 
potential authority forms the actual threat. Take Margaret Thatcher. Her point 
was that if you don't rely on state support but on your individual resources, 
luck is around the corner. The majority didn't believe this, they knew very well 
that most of them would remain poor. But it was enough to be in a position where 
they might succeed. 
</p><p>The idea that you were able to do something, but didn't, gives you more 
satisfaction than actually doing it. In Italy, it is said to be very popular 
during the sexual act that a woman tells a man some dirty phantasies. It is not 
enough that you are actually doing it, you need some phantasmatic, virtual 
support. "You are good, but yesterday I fucked another one and he was better..." 
What interests me are the so-called sado-masochistic, ritualised, sexual 
practices. You never go to the end, you just repeat a certain foreplay. Virtual 
in the sense that you announce it, but never do it. Some write a contract. Even 
when you are doing it, you never lose control, all the time you behave as the 
director of your own game. What fascinates me is this <i>Spaltung</i>, this gap 
in order to remain a certain distance. This distance, far from spoiling 
enjoyment makes it even more intense. Here I see great possibilities for the VR 
stuff. 

</p><p>In the computer I see virtuality, in the sense of symbolic fiction, 
collapsing. This notion has a long tradition. In Bentham's panopticon we find 
virtuality at its purest. You never know if somebody is there in the centre. If 
you knew someone was there, it would have been less horrifying. Now's it's just 
an "utterly dark spot," as Bentham calls it. If someone is following you and 
you're not sure, it is more horrible than if you know that there is somebody. A 
radical uncertainty. 
</p><p><b>CTHEORY:</b> You are famous for your film analyses. But can you imagine 
also using examples from computer networks, analyzing the storyline of a CD-ROM 
or using television material? 
</p><p><b>Zizek:</b> The British Film Institute proposed to me to choose my own six, 
seven films and to do a couple of lectures there, since I use so many film 
examples. They came up with the idea to do a CD-ROM, because I write in the same 
manner: click here, go there, use this fragment, that story or scene. My books 
are already failed CD-ROMs, as someone told me. But because of copyright, it is 
extremely difficult to realize and dirty capitalism will destroy this plan. 
Don't they realize that if you use an excerpt of theirs, you create propaganda 
for them? But it is my dream to do something like this. In my favorite book, 
<cite>Tarrying with the Negative</cite>, I use some fragments of Hitchcock. How 
nice it would be to have it included in the text. But concerning film, I am 
indeed rather conservative. At this moment I am working on the theme of the role 
of music in cinema. The idea is that in the mid-thirties, when the classical 
Hollywood code was established, it was strictly Wagnerian, pure accompanying 
music, radical underscoring, determining your subjective perspective. It's a 
classical case of a conservative revolution. As Wagner said about his 
<i>Gesamtkunstwerk:</i> if we allow music to develop by itself, it will become 
atonal and inimitable. 
</p><p>What I also study are the soundtracks in the films of Lynch and Altman and 
the shift from the landscape to the soundscape. With Altman and Dolby stereo, 
you no longer need the soundtrack as a general frame, as if you have 
inconsistent fragments. The unity is no longer established at the visual level. 
I want to connect this with Altman's <cite>Short Cuts</cite>, with its series of 
faiths, contingently hitting each other. Very Deleuzean: global nonsense where 
contingence encounters produce local effects of sense in order to understand 
what subjective in our late capitalist society means. Or let's take Lynch's 
biggest failure, <cite>Dune</cite>. Did you notice the use of multiple inner 
monologues? Reality is something very fragile for Lynch. If you get too close to 
it you discover Leni Riefenstahl. I am not interested in direct content 
analysis, but the kind of purely formal changes in how we relate to the 
physicality of the film and the shifts in the notions of subjectivity. Of course 
all of this is done in a kindly anti-Derridian swing. For us, it is the sound 
that is the traumatic point, the cry or even the song. The point where you lose 
your unity and the ways the self enjoying voice always gets controlled. What 
interests me at the political level is how the discourse machinery, in order to 
function, has to rely on the obscene voice. What appears to be a carnivalesque 
subversion, this eruption of obscene freedom, really serves the power. But these 
are my B-productions, if you want to put it in Hollywood terms. The A-production 
of the last two years was a book on Schelling that I just finished. 

</p><p><b>CTHEORY:</b> We recently celebrated the centenary of cinema. What's the 
condition of current film theory? What will come after the critical, 
semiological and gender approaches? It is still useful to see film as a unity or 
should we surf through the media, like the users do and use a variety of 
sources? 
</p><p><b>Zizek:</b> Fredric Jameson has already made this point. What goes on in 
cinema is determined by what happens in other media. Concerning theory, there 
are a lot of others, the whole domain of cultural criticism in America is 
basically cinema theory. What attracts me, is the axis between gaze and voice 
and nowhere will you find this tension better than in cinema. This still is for 
me the principal axis. Cinema is for me a kind of condensation. On the one hand 
you have the problem of voice, on the other the narrativisation. 
</p><p>The only change I can think of is that up until twenty years ago, going to 
the cinema was a totally different social experience. It was a Saturday or 
Sunday afternoon, and this changed. But what still appears in ordinary 
commercial films is the shift in the notion of subjectivity. You can detect what 
goes on at the profoundest, most radical level of our symbolic identities and 
how we experience ourselves. Cinema is still the easiest way, like for Freud 
dreams were the royal way to the unconscious. 
</p><p>Maybe I am part of a nostalgic movement. Nowadays, because of all these new 
media, cinema is in a crisis. It becomes popular as a nostalgic medium. And what 
is modern film theory really about? Its ultimate object are nostalgic films from 
the thirties and forties. It is as if you need the theory in order to enjoy 
them. It's incredible how even Marxists enjoy this game. They have seen every 
film, I'm not joking. It's not only this paternalising notion that it is good to 
use examples from cinema. I would still claim that there is an inherent logic of 
the theory itself, as if there is a privileged relationship, like the role 
literature played in the nineteenth century. 
</p><p><b>CTHEORY:</b> You have been to Japan. What's your opinion on the 
technological culture in that country? 
</p><p><b>Zizek:</b> First I must say that I don't have my own positive theory about 
Japan. What I do have, as every Western intellectual, are the myths of 
reference. There is the old, right-wing image of the Samurai code, fighting to 
death, the absolute, ethical Japan. Then there is the leftist image, from 
Eisenstein: the semiotic Japan. The empty signs, no Western metaphysics of 
presence. It's a no less phantasmatic Japan then the first one. We know that 
Eisenstein for his montage of attractions used Japanese ideograms. 
</p><p>Then there is Bertolt Brecht as an exception. He took over elements like 
sacrifice and authority and put them in a left-wing context. Here in the West, 
Brecht was seen as someone introducing a fanatic Eastern morality. But now 
there's in Suhrkamp Verlag a detailed edition of his "Jasager" and his 
"Lernstcke". They discovered that all those moments the Western critics 
perceived as remainders of this imperial and sacrificing Japan were indeed 
edited by Brecht. What they perceived as Japanese was Brecht. 
</p><p>Then there is the capitalist Japan and its different stages. There is the 
myth of non-original Japan taking over, but developing better: Philips for the 
rich and Sony for the poor. Twenty years later this was of course the other way 
round. Then there is the Kojevian Japan. First, for Kojeve the end of history 
was Russia and America, the realisation of the French Revolution. Then he 
noticed that something was missing. He found the answer in Japan, in the little 
surplus. If everything only functions, as in America, you would kill yourself. 
In the snobbism, drinking tea in a nice way, he found that life still had a 
meaning. 
</p><p>But there is another Japan, the psycho-analytic. For the multi-culturalist 
approach, the almost standard example is Japan and its way of <i>Verneinung</i>, 
saying no. There are thirty ways to say no. You say no to your wife in one way, 
no to a child in another way. There is not one negation. There is a small 
Lacanian volume, <cite>La chose japonaise</cite>. They elaborate the borrowing 
of other languages, all these ambiguities. Didn't Lacan say that Japanese do not 
have an unconscious? 

</p><p>For the West, Japan is the ambiguous Other: at the same time it fascinates 
you and repels you. Let's not forget the psychological cliche of Japan: you 
smile, but you never know if it is sincere or if you are mocking us - the idea 
of Japan as the impenetrable Other. This ambiguous politeness. What do they 
really want? There's also the idea of the Japanese as the "ersatz" Jews for the 
Americans. The Japanese governments together with two or three mega companies, 
plotting. All this spleen, this palette of phantasies, is Japan for us. But what 
surprised me is that authors, whom I considered strictly European, are widely 
read in Japan, as for example George Lukacs. 
</p><p>Then there is a Japan, loved by those who criticize our Western, decadent way 
of liberal democracy and who look for a model that would combine the dynamics of 
capitalism, while maintaining some firm traditional structure of authority. And 
again, it can work both ways. What I like about phantasies is that they are 
always ambiguous. You can turn it in a negative way, Japanese pretending to play 
capitalism, while in reality what you have is conspiracy and authority. On the 
positive side you see that there is a capitalism possible with moral values. 
</p><p>What I liked there, in restaurants and subway stations, is the absence of 
English. You don't have this self-humiliating, disgusting, pleasing attitude. 
It's up to the foreigners to find their way out. I liked tremendously those 
automatic vending machines. Did you see <cite>The Shining</cite>, based on 
Stephen King's novel? This is America at its worst. Three people, a family, in a 
big hotel and still the space is too small for them and they start killing each 
other. In Japan, even when it is very crowded, you don't feel the pressure, even 
if you are physically close. The art of ignoring. In the New York subway, even 
when it's half full, you would have this horrifying experience of the absolute 
proximity of the Other. What I liked about the Foucault conference in Tokyo I 
attended was that one would expect the Japanese to apply Foucault to their own 
notions. But all the Japanese interventions were about Flaubert. They didn't 
accept this anthropological game of playing idiots for you. No, they tried to 
beat us at our own game. We know Flaubert better than you. 
</p><p>Every nation in Europe has this fanaticism, conceiving itself as the true, 
primordial nation. The Serbian myth, for example, is that they are the first 
nation of the world. The Croatians consider themselves as primordial Aryans. The 
Slovenians are not really Slavs, but pretend to be of Etrurian origin. It would 
be nice to find a nation that accepts the fact of being the second and not the 
first. This might be a part of the Japanese identity, if you look at the way 
they borrow languages. 
</p><p>I recently read a book on Kurosawa. It is said that <cite>Rashomon</cite> was 
seen in the early fifties as the big discovery of the Eastern spirit. But in 
Japan it was perceived as way too Western. My favorite Japanese film is 
<cite>Sansho</cite> by Michoguchi because it offers itself for a nice, Lacanian 
reading, the problem of the lost mother, the mother's voice reaching the son, 
etc. This is the Japanese advantage over America when the mother's voice tries 
to reach the son. In America one would get madness, like Hitchcock's 
<cite>Psycho</cite>, but in Japan you get a normal family. 
</p><p>The Balkans is now a region where the West is projecting its own phantasies, 
like Japan. And again, this can be very contradictory. The film <cite>Rising 
Sun</cite>s ambiguously suggests that there is a Japanese plot to take over and 
buy Hollywood. The idea is that they do not just want our factories, our land, 
they even want our dreams. Behind this there's the notion of thought control. 
It's the old Marxist notion of buying the whole chain, from the hardware until 
the movie theatres. What interests me in Japan is that it is a good argument 
against the vulgar, pseudo-Marxist evolutionary notion that you have to go 
through certain evolutionary stages. Japan proves that you can make a direct 
short circuit. You retain certain elements of the old hierarchical 
superstructure and combine it very nicely with the most effective version of 
capitalism it pretends to be. It's a good experience in non-anthropocentrism. 
It's a mystery for Western sociologists who say that you need Protestant ethics 
for good capitalism. 

</p><p>What I see in Japan, and maybe this is my own myth, is that behind all these 
notions of politeness, snobbism etc. the Japanese are well aware that something 
which may appear superficial and unnecessary has a much deeper structural 
function. A Western approach would be: who needs this? But a totally ridiculous 
thing at a deeper level might play a stabilizing function we are not aware of. 
Everybody laughs at the English monarchy, but you'll never know. 
</p><p>There is another notion that is popular now amongst American sociologists, 
the civilizations of guilt versus civilizations of shame. The Jews and their 
inner guilt and the Greeks with their culture of shame. The usual cliche now is 
that Japan is the ultimate civilization of shame. What I despise in America is 
the studio actors' logic, as if there is something good in self-expression: do 
not be oppressed, open yourself, even if you shout and kick the others, 
everything in order to express and liberate yourself. This is a stupid idea, 
that behind the mask there is some truth. In Japan, and I hope that this is not 
only a myth, even if something is merely an appearance, politeness is not simply 
insincere. There is a difference between saying "Hello, how are you?" and the 
New York taxi drivers who swear at you. Surfaces do matter. If you disturb the 
surfaces you may lose a lot more than you think. You shouldn't play with 
rituals. Masks are never simply mere masks. Perhaps that's why Brecht became 
close to Japan. He also liked this notion that there is nothing really 
liberating in this typical Western gesture of stealing the masks and showing the 
true face. What you discover is something absolutely disgusting. Let's maintain 
the appearances, that's my own phantasy of Japan.
