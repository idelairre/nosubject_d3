Defined by Freud as a process which allows the individual to distinguish between external stimuli and internal stimuli from within the psyche, and to establish the vital inner/outer distinction.
Reality-testing is a defence against hallucination and the confusion of what is actually perceived and what is imagined.
Reality-testing is one of the major functions of the ego.


'[[Reality testing]]' is defined as the [[process]] through which the [[psyche]] gauges the [[difference]] between the [[internal]] and [[external]] [[world]]s. 

Acccording to [[Freud]], the [[process]] of [[reality testing]] is a function of the [[ego]], founded on [[perception]] and [[motility]].

In ''[[A Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams]]'' (1915), [[Freud]] describes the [[process]] of [[reality testing]] as a way for the [[psyche]] to determine whether the experience it is undergoing is present or is the recall of a previous one.

The need for both of these concepts in psychoanalysis stems from the psyche's proclivity to hallucinate. If a previous experience is hallucinated, meaning made present to perception by the action of intense instinctual cathexis, this may fog up the ego's capacities to differentiate between past and present, internal and external, and thus require it to refer to the intensity of the cathexis to differentiate between actual perception and hallucination.


In Freud's inaugural texts, the ego's capacity to make and change cathexes devolves upon reality testing. In the texts that followed, this capacity was assumed by perception, which conveys external reality inward (1911b), then motility, which enables flight from extreme sources of excitation and thereby enables the ego to differentiate the excitation from internal sources (1916-1917f).

However, all of these processes assume means that cannot be used in the psychoanalytic session, where motility and perception are in large part suspended. Freud's successors, Winnicott in particular, have therefore emphasized another process that contributes to distinguishing the realm of fantasy and differentiating internal and external realities. This process is based on the fact that external reality resists fantasized destruction and is not destroyed by it. Reality, or rather externality, can thus be discovered by its capacities to resist the subject's destructiveness. This confers upon the analysis of negative transference a preponderant role in treatment.
