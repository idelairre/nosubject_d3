A year or so ago, while waiting in line to pay at a London Waterstone bookstore, I 
overheard a young man asking one of the staff: 'I just finished <i>Mrs de Winter</i>. Is it true 
that this is the sequel to another book?' This was for me a depressing encounter with the 
illiteracy of the younger generation-how can anyone not know about <i>Rebecca</i>?<br><br> 
 
Or is this oblivion perhaps deserved? There is something radically untimely about 
Daphne du Maurier: her prose seems marked by a melodramatic excess that often comes 
dangerously close to the ridiculous-after reading one of her books, it is difficult to avoid 
the vague sentiment that it is no longer possible to write like that today. <a name="1"></a><a href="#1x">1</a> She tells stories without truly being a writer; in what, then, resides the secret of the undisputed 
tremendous power of fascination exerted by her stories? What if these two features are 
somehow connected? What if her lack of style, her pathetic directness, is the formal 
effect of the fact that du Maurier's narratives directly, all too directly, stage the fantasies 
that sustain our lives? The notion of fantasy has to be taken here in all its fundamental 
ambiguity: far from being opposed to reality, fantasy is that which provides the basic 
coordinates of what we experience as 'reality' (as Lacan puts it, 'everything we are 
allowed to approach by way of reality remains rooted in fantasy' <a name="2"></a><a href="#2x">2</a>) - however, in order to fulfil this function, it has to remain hidden, it must exert its efficiency in the background: 
'If what [neurotics] long for the most intensely in their phantasies is presented them in 
reality, they none the less flee from it'. <a name="3"></a><a href="#3x">3</a> And it is this properly shameless, often 
embarrassing, direct staging of fantasies that makes du Maurier's writing so 
compelling-especially when compared with aseptic 'politically correct' feminism. <a name="4"></a><a href="#4x">4</a><br><br> 
 

According to the Jewish tradition, Lilith is the woman a man makes love to while he 
masturbates alone in his bed during the night - far from standing for the feminine identity 
liberated from the patriarchal hold, her status is purely phallic: she is what Lacan calls <i>La 
femme</i>, the Woman, the fantasmatic supplement of the male masturbatory phallic 
<i>jouissance</i>. Significantly, while there is only one man (Adam), femininity is from the 
very beginning split between Eve and Lilith, between the 'ordinary' hysterical feminine 
subject and the fantasmatic spectre of Woman: when a man is having sex with a 'real' 
woman, he is using her as a masturbatory prop to support his fantasizing about the non- 
existent Woman... And in <i>Rebecca</i>, her most famous novel, du Maurier adds another 
twist to the Lilith myth: the fantasy of Woman is (re)appropriated by a woman - what if 
Lilith is not so much a male fantasy as the fantasy of a woman, the model of her 
fantasmatic competitor?<br><br> 
 
So where does du Maurier belong? Properly speaking, she is flanked, on one side, by 
Romanticism, with its notion of radical Evil ('pleasure in pain'), and, on the other side, 
by Freud, and the direct impact of psychoanalysis on arts - why? It is interesting to note 
that Lacan identified the beginning of the movement of ideas that finally gave birth to 
psychoanalysis as being that of Kantian ethics (particularly his <i>Critique of Practical 
Reason</i>) and the Romantic notion of 'pleasure in pain'. <a name="5"></a><a href="#5x">5</a> It is this epoch that provides the only proper ground for what is deceitfully called 'applied psychoanalysis'. Prior to this 
moment, the universe was one in which the Unconscious was not yet operative, in which 
the 'subject' was identified with the Light of Reason as opposed to the impersonal Night 
of drives, and not, in the very kernel of its being, this Night itself; afterwards, the very 
impact of psychoanalysis transformed artistic literary practice (Eugene O'Neill's plays, 
for example, already presuppose psychoanalysis, whereas Henry James, Katherine 
Mansfield and even Kafka do not). It is also within this horizon that du Maurier moves- 
this space of the heroic innocence of the Unconscious in which irresistible passions freely 
roam around.<br><br> 
 
There is one term that encapsulates everything that renders this space-and du Maurier's 
writing itself-so problematic for contemporary feminism: feminine masochism. What du 
Maurier stages again and again in a shamelessly direct way is the different figure of 
'feminine masochism', of a woman enjoying her own ruin, finding a tortured satisfaction 
in her subjection and humiliation, etc. So how are we to redeem this feature? 
The ultimate point of irreconciliable difference between psychoanalysis and feminism is 
that of rape (and/or the masochist fantasies that sustain it). For standard feminism, at 
least, it is an a priori axiom that rape is a violence imposed from without: even if a 
woman fantasizes about being raped, this only bears witness to the deplorable fact that 
she has internalized the male attitude. The reaction is here one of pure panic: the moment 
one mentions that a woman may fantasize about being raped or at least brutally 
mishandled, one hears the objections: 'This is like saying that Jews fantasize about being 
gassed in the camps, or African-Americans fantasize about being lynched!' From this 
perspective, the split hysterical position (that of complaining about being sexually 
misused and exploited, while simultaneously desiring it and provoking a man to seduce 
her) is secondary, while for Freud, it is primary, constitutive of subjectivity. 
Consequently, the problem with rape for Freud is that it has such a traumatic impact not 
simply because it is a case of such brutal external violence, but because it also touches on 
something disavowed in the victim herself. So when Freud writes, 'If what [neurotics] 
long for the most intensely in their phantasies is presented them in reality, they none the 
less flee from it', his point is not merely that this aversion occurs because of censorship, 
but, rather, that the core of our fantasy is unbearable to us. (Of course, this insight in no 
way justifies rape along the infamous lines 'she just got what she fantasized about...' - if 
anything, it makes it more violent: what could be more brutal than to impose on someone 
the traumatic core of his/her fantasy?)<br><br> 
 

What this means is that, paradoxically, the staging of what appears to be a masochist 
scenario is the first act of liberation: by means of it, the servant's masochistic libidinal 
attachment to his master is brought into the light of day, and the servant thus achieves a 
minimal distance towards it. In his essay on Sacher-Masoch, <a name="6"></a><a href="#6x">6</a> Gilles Deleuze elaborated this aspect in detail: far from bringing any satisfaction to the sadistic witness, the 
masochist's self-torture frustrates the sadist, depriving him of his power over the 
masochist. Sadism involves a relationship of domination, while masochism is necessarily 
the first step towards liberation. <a name="7"></a><a href="#7x">7</a> When we are subjected to a power mechanism, this subjection is always and by definition sustained by some libidinal investment: the 
subjection itself generates a surplus-enjoyment of its own. This subjection is embodied in 
a network of 'material' bodily practices, and, for this reason, we cannot get rid of our 
subjection through a merely intellectual reflection-our liberation has to be staged in 
some kind of bodily performance, and, furthermore, this performance has to be of an 
apparently 'masochistic' nature, it has to stage the painful process of hitting back at 
oneself. Did Sylvia Plath not adopt the same strategy in her famous poem 'Daddy'?</font></p>
<font size="3"> 
</font><blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3"> 
What she does in the poem is, with a weird detachment, to turn the violence 
against herself so as to show that she can equal her oppressors with her self- 
inflicted oppression. And this is the strategy of the concentration camps. When 
suffering is there whatever you do, by inflicting it upon yourself you achieve your 
identity, you set yourself free. <a name="8"></a><a href="#8x">8</a></font></p><font size="3"> 
</font></blockquote>
<font size="3"> 
</font><p align="justify">

<font size="3">This also resolves the problem of Plath's reference to the holocaust, i.e., the reproach of 
some of her critics that her implicit equation of her oppression by her father to what the 
Nazis did to the Jews is an inadmissible exaggeration: what matters is not the (obviously 
incomparable) magnitude of the crime, but the fact that Plath felt compelled to adopt the 
strategy of turning violence against herself as the only means of psychic liberation. For 
this reason, it is also far too simplistic to dismiss her thoroughly ambiguous hysterical 
attitude towards her father (horror at his oppressive presence and, simultaneously, her 
obvious libidinal fascination by him - 'Every woman adores a Fascist, the boot in the 
face...' <a name="9"></a><a href="#9x">9</a>): this hysterical knot of the libidinal investment of one's own victimization can never be undone. That is to say, one cannot oppose the 'redemptive' awareness of being 
oppressed to the 'pathological' enjoyment the hysterical subject gains from this very 
oppression, interpreting their conjunction as the result of the 'liberation from patriarchal 
domination as an unfinished project' (to paraphrase Habermas), i.e., as the index of a split 
between the 'good' feminist awareness of subjection and the persisting patriarchal 
libidinal economy which chains the hysteric to patriarchy, making her subordination into 
a <i>servitude volontaire</i>. If this were the case, then the solution would be simple: one would 
enact what, apropos of Proudhon, Marx characterized as the exemplary petty bourgeois 
procedure of distinguishing in every phenomenon a 'good' and a 'bad' aspect, and then 
affirming the good and getting rid of the bad-in our case, struggling to keep the 'good' 
aspect (awareness of oppression) and discard the 'bad' one (finding pleasure in 
oppression). The reason this 'untying of the knot' doesn't work is that the only true 
awareness of our subjection is the awareness of the obscene excessive pleasure (surplus- 
enjoyment) we gain from it-which is why the first gesture of liberation is not to get rid 
of this excessive pleasure, but actively to assume it. If, following Franz Fanon, we define 
political violence not as opposed to work, but, precisely, as the ultimate political version 
of the 'work of the negative', of the educational self-formation, then violence should 
primarily be conceived as self-violence, as a violent re-formation of the very substance of 
subject's being.<br><br> 
 
Consequently, the first thing to do in every case of masochism is to look for the 
'collateral damage' that generates the accidental side-profit. In one of the anti-Soviet 
jokes popular after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, a fairy-queen 
approaches a Czech and tells him that she is ready to grant him three wishes; the Czech 
immediately offers his first wish: 'The Chinese army should occupy my country for a 
month and then withdraw!' After the fairy-queen asks him for the other two wishes, he 
says: 'The same again! The Chinese should occupy us again and again!' When the 
bewildered queen asks him why he chose such a strange wish, the Czech answers with a 
malicious grin: 'Because each time the Chinese were to occupy us, they would have to 
pass through the Soviet Union on their way here and back!' The same holds often for 
'feminine masochism', and especially for du Maurier's stories whose heroines enjoying 
their painful passions: they follow the logic of displacement, i.e., to interpret them 
properly, one should focus attention on the third (male) subject who is targeted when a 
woman is repeatedly 'occupied by the Chinese army'.<br><br> 
 
This, then, is what du Maurier is doing when she is staging elementary fantasmatic 
narratives, and, perhaps, nowhere is this clearer than in six of her short stories: 'The 
Birds', 'Monte Verità', 'The Apple Tree', 'The Little Photographer', 'Kiss Me Again, 
Stranger' and 'The Old Man'. <a name="10"></a><a href="#10x">10</a> They are to be read in the same way that Claude Lévi- Strauss interpreted myths: instead of directly searching for a hidden meaning within each 
of them, they should be interpreted through each other, read side by side-the moment 
one does it, one perceives that they form a precise structure. The central four stories 
present four versions of why sexual relationship fails. In 'Monte Verità', a beautiful 
young Anna abandons her husband and potential lover for the 'Truth Mountain', a remote 
resort in the Swiss Alps, the seat of an initiatic group who lead there a secluded life of 
immortality, a life of eternal ecstatic satisfaction exempted from the traumas of our 
'world of men and women'-in short, she chooses what Lacan called the Other 
<i>Jouissance</i> over ordinary phallic <i>jouissance</i>. In 'The Apple Tree', an older husband 
whose neglected wife died a while ago suddenly notices how a malformed apple tree 
close to his house bears an uncanny resemblance to her; the tree starts to haunt him and 
he dies, entangled in its fallen wings in a winter storm. In 'The Little Photographer', a 
lone, bored beautiful wife who married into rich nobility becomes involved in a weird 
and humiliating love affair with a poor crippled local photographer while on holiday at a 
seaside resort. In 'Kiss Me Again, Stranger', a young mechanic spends a long evening 
with a mysterious girl who is the following day revealed to be the serial murderer of 
several RAF pilots. In all four stories, the intrusion of an unexpected dimension disturbs 
the 'normal' run of things and ruins the prospect of a satisfied, calm life of a couple: the 
fantasmatic Other Place of non-phallic <i>jouissance</i>; the return of the dead wife in the guise 
of the tree as a conversion-symptom that haunts the husband; the strange lure of the low- 
class, doggishly faithful, repulsive lover; the unexpected lethal dimension of an ordinary 
girl. The first and the last stories are, in clear contrast, the ones with a 'happy' couple. 
'The Birds' (on which, of course, Hitchcock's film is based) tells the story of a 
countryside family of tenants on the Cornwall coast who had to deal with attacking birds. 
In 'The Old Man', the observer witnesses how a strange couple living in a cottage near 
the sea maintains their secluded happiness by killing their intrusive son whose presence 
started to disturb their idyll. The two 'happy' families are thus more than weird: the one 
lives under siege by the attacking birds; the other has to secure its happiness by killing 
their offspring...<br><br>

 
Especially instructive here is 'The Birds', especially if we compare du Maurier's original 
story with Hitchcock's film: while both share the same fantasmatic cataclysmic event, 
this event is in each case included in a different context that confers upon it an entirely 
different meaning. In order to unravel Hitchcock's <i>The Birds</i>, one should first imagine 
the film without the birds, simply depicting the proverbial middle-class family in the 
midst of an Oedipal crisis-the attacks of the birds can only be accounted for as an outlet 
of the tension underlying this Oedipal constellation, i.e., they clearly materialize the 
destructive outburst of the maternal superego, one mother's jealousy toward the young 
woman who tries to snatch her son from her. The same procedure should also be applied 
to du Maurier's 'The Birds': her 'Birds without birds' would have been a sketch of hard 
English peasant life, of tough characters who are aware that, ultimately, they can only 
rely on themselves, and are able to keep their mind and provide for their survival even in 
the most disturbing circumstances. The attacking birds here are thus to bring out the best 
of the tough character of the 'ordinary' English peasant-against what? Hints scattered 
throughout the story make it clear that the true target of the story is the post-World War II 
Labour Welfare State: the state fails to react properly to the threat of the birds and, 
towards the end of the story, simply ceases to function.<br><br>
 
And the same goes for the other stories: one should first imagine an alternate version 
without the disturbing intrusion. 'Monte Verità without Monte Verità' would have been a 
story about an apparently happy and prosperous young couple, in which the wife is 
nonetheless not fully satisfied, haunted by visions of and longing for a different, more 
emancipated, life. 'The Apple Tree' would have been a depressing story about an old 
couple whose superficially calm life conceals silent despair and cruel ignorance. 'The 
Little Photographer' would have been a vignette on a beautiful girl who married for 
money but is now condemned to lead a suffocating, aseptic existence of empty family 
rituals, cut off from the bustle of real life. 'Kiss Me Again, Stranger' would have been a 
story of the everyday emotional misery of a young mechanic unable to find a stable love 
relationship. Finally, 'The Old Man' would have been a portrait of utter immobility: a 
couple isolated from society, living in a state of psychotic seclusion... The intrusive 
Event (birds attacking, the twisted apple tree, the strangely attractive crippled 
photographer, etc.) is then nothing but a fantasized escape from this misery, a figure that 
renders all the more palpable the misery of its everyday background - can one imagine a 
more devastating picture of the choices life is offering us today?<br><br> 
 
The paradox of old gramophone recordings is that, today, we perceive the singing voice 
whose clarity is obfuscated by scratches as more 'realistic' than the most faithful Dolby- 
stereo or THX recording - as if the very imperfection of the rendering is a proof that the 
'real voice' was there, while, in the second case, the very perfection derealizes what we 
hear, turning it into an experience of a perfect fake. And, perhaps, this is how one should 
read du Maurier's texts: their very scratches - what makes them old-fashioned, often 
ridiculous-are also what keeps them alive.<br><br>

<a name="1x"></a><a href="#1">1</a> However, does the same not hold for many a great classic? Is it still possible 
today to listen to the first movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony with the 
naïve recognition of the persistent knocking of fate, or is this movement forever 
lost on account of its later 'commodification'?<br><br>
