<blockquote>In the eyes of the law, a quack is one who treats patients without being able to produce a State medical degree. I should prefer another definition: a quack is a person who undertakes a treatment without possessing the knowledge and capacity required for it.<ref>{{QLA}} Ch. 6</ref></blockquote>
