==violent revolution==
<blockquote>This acceptance of violence, this "political suspension of the ethical," is the limit of that which even the most "tolerant" liberal stance is unable to trespass - witness the uneasiness of "radical" post-colonialist Afro-American studies apropos of [[Frantz Fanon]]'s fundamental insight into the unavoidability of violence in the process of effective decolonization. One should recall here [[Fredric Jameso]]n's idea that violence plays in a revolutionary process the same role as worldly wealth in the Calvinist logic of [[predestination]]: although it has no intrinsic value, it is a sign of the authenticity of the revolutionary process, of the fact that this process is effectively disturbing the existing power relations. In other words, the dream of the revolution without violence is precisely the dream of a "revolution without revolution"(Robespierre). On the other hand, the role of the Fascist spectacle of violence is exactly opposite: it is a violence whose aim is to PREVENT the true change - something spectacular should happen all the time so that, precisely, nothing would really happen.<ref>violence</ref></blockquote>
