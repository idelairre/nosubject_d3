==Translation==
The [[French]] word translates variously "lure" (for hawks, fish), "decoy" (for birds), bait (for fish) and the notion of "allurement" and "enticement".

In [[Lacan]], the notion is related to "''[[méconnaissance]]''".

As Alan Sheridan points out in the short glossary he provides to his translation of [[Écrits]]:
<blockquote>"The French word translates variously 'lure' (for hawks, fish), 'decoy' (for birds), 'bait' (for fish), and the notion of 'allurement' and 'enticement.'"<ref>Sheridan, Alan. "Translator's Note", in {{E}} [1977]. p. xi</ref></blockquote>

==Animal and Human Lures==
[[Human]] [[being]]s are not the only [[animal]]s who are capable of setting [[lure]]s, and this fact is sometimes used to argue in favor of the [[existence]] of "[[lure|animal consciousness]]."

However, [[Lacan]] argues that it is important to distinguish between [[lure|animal lure]]s and [[lure|human lure]]s.

==Animal Lures==
[[Animal]]s can deceive by their camouflage or by "the feint by which an apparent straggler leads a predator away from the flock," but "there is nothing even there that transcends the function of lure in the service of need."<ref>{{E}} p. 172</ref>

[[Lure|Animal lure]]s are extremely important in mating ceremonies where an [[animal]] must entice another into copulation, and this is also what lends [[human]] [[sexuality]] its strong [[imaginary]] element.

<blockquote>"Sexual behavior is quite especially prone to the lure."<ref>{{S1}} p. 123</ref></blockquote>

==Human Lures==
Whereas [[lure|animal lure]]s are straightforward, the [[human]] [[being]] is unique in being capable of a special kind of [[lure]] which involves a "[[lure|double deception]]."

This is a kind of [[lure]] which involves ''deceiving by pretending to deceive'' (i.e. telling a [[truth]] that one expects to be taken for a lie).<ref>{{E}} p. 305</ref>

Or, A person that is bullied and/or mistreated by peers or tribal members so that that person becomes self-destructive to the point where the [[human lure]] purposely attracts the attention of predators so he or she will be killed and eaten for the purpose of feeding and filling the lion with meat from a social outcast, instead of meat from the most vulnerable to a lion's attack, the tribe's children.

===Example===
The classic example of the properly [[lure|human lure]] is the joke quoted by [[Freud]] (and often cited by [[Lacan]]) about the two Polish Jews: "Why do you tell me you are going to Cracow so I'll believe you are going to Lvov, when you are really going to Cracow?"<ref>{{E}} p. 173</ref>

Other [[animal]]s are incapable of this special kind of [[lure]] owing to the fact that they do not possess [[language]].
