=====Roman Jakobson=====
[[Lacan]] borrows the term "[[code]]" from [[Roman Jakobson]]'s theory of [[communication]]. 

[[Jakobson]] presents his opposition "[[code]] vs [[message]]" as an equivalent of [[Saussure]]'s ''[[langue]]'' vs ''[[parole]]''.

=====Jacques Lacan=====
=====Code and Language=====
However, [[Lacan]] draws an important distinction between the concepts of [[language]] and [[code]].<ref>{{E}} p. 84</ref> 

[[Code]]s are the province of [[animal]] [[communication]], not of [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] [[communication]]. 

=====Index and Signifier=====
Whereas the elements of a [[language]] are [[signifier]]s, the elements of a [[code]] are [[indices]].
 
The fundamental difference is that there is a fixed bi-univocal (one-to-one) relationship between an [[index]] and its [[referent]], whereas there is no such relationship between a [[signifier]] and a [[referent]] or between a [[signifier]] and a [[signified]]. 

=====Ambiguity and Equivocation=====
Because of the bi-univocal relation of [[indices]] and [[referent]]s, [[code]]s lack what [[Lacan]] regards as the fundamental feature of [[human]] [[language]]s: the potential for ambiguity and equivocation.<ref>{{L}} (1973b) "[[Works of Jacques Lacan|L'Ã‰tourdit]]", ''Scilicet'', no. 4, 1973. pp. 5-52</ref>

[[Lacan]] is not always consistent in maintaining this opposition between [[code]] and [[language]]. 

In the [[seminar]] of 1958-9, for example, when presenting the [[elementary cell]] of the [[graph of desire]], he designates one point as the [[code]], which he also designates as the place of the [[Other]] and the battery of [[signifier]]s. 

In this case, it is clear that the term "[[code]]" is being used in the same sense as the term "[[language]]," namely, to designate the set of [[signifier]]s available to the [[subject]].
