<blockquote>The sexual life of the human being does not develop in progressive fashion from incipience to maturity, as in the case of most of the closely related animals, but it suffers an abrupt interruption after an initial early florescence extending to about the fifth year, after which it commences anew with puberty, dovetailing, as it were, with the tendencies of the infantile period.<ref>{{PoA}} Ch. 10</ref></blockquote>

===Sexual Life and Civilization===
<blockquote>The sexual life of civilized man is seriously disabled, whatever we may say; it sometimes makes an impression of being a function in process of becoming atrophied, just as organs like our teeth and our hair seem to be.<ref>{{C&D}} Ch. 4</ref></blockquote>
