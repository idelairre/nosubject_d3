==Freud's Self-analysis and its importance for the development of psycho-analysis ==

In his forties, Freud "had numerous psychosomatic disorders as well as exaggerated fears of dying and other phobias" (Corey 2001, p. 67). During this time Freud was involved in the task of exploring his own dreams, memories, and the dynamics of his personality development. During this self-analysis, he came to realize the hostility he felt towards his father (Jacob Freud), who had died in 1896, and "he also recalled his childhood sexual feelings for his mother (Amalia Freud), who was attractive, warm, and protective" (Corey 2001, p. 67) considers this time of emotional difficulty to be the most creative time in Freud's life. 

The many examples in the Psychopathology of Everyday Life and the Interpretation of Dreams contain self-analysis of Freud's own dreams and parapraxis (such as: the Signorelli Parapraxis and Irma's Injection.)

==Freudian Dictionary==
<blockquote>We consider that everyone who wishes to treat others by analysis should first undergo an analysis himself. Only in the course of this "self-analysis" (as it is mistakently termed), when he actually experiences in his own person, or rather in his own psyche, the processes asserted by analysis to take place, does he acquire the convictions by which he will be later guided as an analyst.<ref>{{QLA}} Ch. 2</ref></blockquote>
