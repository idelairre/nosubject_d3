<blockquote>The union of the genitals in the characteristic act of copulation is taken as the normal sexual aim. It serves to diminish the sexual tension and to quench temporarily the sexual desire (gratification analogous to satisfaction of hunger). Yet, even in the most normal sexual act, certain addenda are distinguishable, the development of which may lead to aberrations described as ''perversions''.<ref>{{TCTS}} I</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>The execution of the sex act presupposes a very complicated sequence of events, anyone of which may be the locus of disturbance.<ref>{{PoA}} Ch. 1</ref></blockquote>
