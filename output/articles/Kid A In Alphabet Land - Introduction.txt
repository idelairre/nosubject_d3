== An Introduction To The Electronic Edition ==
This is the electronic edition of ''Kid A In Alphabet Land'', "an abecedarian roller coaster ride through the phallocentric obscurantism of Jacques Lacan."

''Kid A In Alphabet Land'' was originally designed as a tangible trading card set, and, as such, works best in that medium. This electronic edition of ''Kid A In Alphabet Land'' is intended to bring the set to a wider audience than it otherwise might reach. I've considered linking the in-line graphics to larger-size, better-quality external images, and creating hypertext links to and from related concepts and to more detailed explanations of the Lacanian concepts and cultural references involved; currently and in the foreseeable future, however, my time doesn't allow such an undertaking.
