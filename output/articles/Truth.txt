[[Truth]] is one of the most central, and yet most complex terms in [[Lacan]]'s discourse. 

==Psychoanalysis==
The [[aim]] of [[psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]] is to lead the [[analysand]] to articulate the [[truth]] of his or her [[desire]].

[[Truth]] does not await, in some preformed state of fullness, to be revealed to the [[analysand]] by the [[analyst]], but is rather constructed in the [[dialectic]]al movement of the [[treatment]] itself.<ref>{{Ec}} p.144</ref> 

==Philosophy==
[[Lacan]] argues, in opposition to the traditions of classical [[philosophy]], that [[truth]] is not beautiful<ref>{{S7}} p.217</ref> and that it is not necessarily beneficial to learn the [[truth]].<ref>{{S17}} p.122</ref> 

[[Lacan]] speaks about "[[truth]]" in the singular, not as a single [[universal]] [[truth]], but as [[particular]] [[truth]], unique to each [[subject]].<ref>{{S7}} p.24</ref> 

==Language==
[[Truth]] is only a meaningful concept in the context of [[language]]: 

<blockquote>"It is with the appearance of [[language]] that the dimension of [[truth]] emerges."<ref>{{E}} p.172</ref></blockquote>

[[Psychoanalytic]] [[treatment]] is based on the fundamental premise that [[speech]] is the only means of revealing the [[truth]] about [[desire]]. 

<blockquote>"[[Truth]] hollows its way into the [[real]] thanks to the dimension of [[speech]]. There is neither [[true]] nor [[false]] prior to [[speech]]."<ref>{{S1}} p.228</ref></blockquote>

==Science==
From [[Lacan]]'s earliest writings, the term "[[truth]]" has metaphysical,  even mystical, nuances which problematise any attempt to articulate [[truth]] and [[science]]. 

It is not that [[Lacan]] denies that [[science]] aims to know the [[truth]], but simply that [[science]] cannot claim to monopolise [[truth]] as its exclusive property.<ref>{{Ec}} p.79</ref> 

[[Lacan]] later argues that [[science]] is in fact based on a [[foreclosure]] of the concept of [[truth]] as [[cause]].<ref>{{Ec}} p.874</ref> 

The concept of [[truth]] is essential for understanding [[madness]], and modern [[science]] renders [[madness]] meaningless by ignoring the concept of [[truth]].<ref>{{Ec}} p.153-4</ref>

==Truth and Deception==
[[Truth]] is intimately connected with [[deception]], since lies can often reveal the [[truth]] about [[desire]] more eloquently than honest statements. 

[[Deception]] and lies are not the opposite of [[truth]]: on the contrary, they are inscribed in the text of [[truth]]. 

The [[analyst]]'s role is to reveal the [[truth]] inscribed in the [[deception]] of the [[analysand]]'s [[speech]]. 

Although the [[analysand]] may in effect be saying to the [[analyst]] "I am deceiving you," the [[analyst]] says to the [[analysand]]:

<blockquote>"In this I am deceiving to you, what you are sending as message is what I express to you, and in doing so you are telling the truth.<ref>{{S11}} p.139-40; {{S4}} p.107-8)</ref></blockquote>

==False Appearances==
The false [[appearance]]s presented by the [[analysand]] are not merely obstacles that the [[analyst]] must expose and discard in order to discover the [[truth]]; on the contrary, the [[analyst]] must take them into account (see [[semblance]]).

==Error and Mistakes==
[[Psychoanalysis]] has shown that the [[truth]] about [[desire]] is often revealed by mistakes (parapraxes). 

The complex relations between [[truth]], mistakes, error and [[deception]] are evoked by [[Lacan]] in a typically elusive phrase when he describes "the structuration of speech in search of truth" as "error taking flight in deception and recaptured by mistake."<ref>{{S1}} p. 273</ref>

==Fiction==
[[Lacan]] does not use the term "[[fiction]]" in the sense of 'a falsehood', but in the sense of a [[scientific]] construct.<ref>{{S7}} p.12</ref> 

Thus [[Lacan]]'s term "[[fiction]]" corresponds to [[Freud]]'s term ''Konvention'', convention,<ref>{{S11}} p.163</ref> and has more in common with [[truth]] than falsehood. 

Indeed, [[Lacan]] states that [[truth]] is [[structure]]d like a [[fiction]].<ref>{{E}} 306; {{Ec}} 808</ref>

==The Real==
The opposition which [[Lacan]] draws between [[truth]] and the [[real]] dates back to his pre-war writings,<ref>{{Ec}} p.75</ref> and is taken up at various points; 

<blockquote>"We are used to the real. The truth we repress."<ref>{{E}} p.169</ref></blockquote>

However, [[Lacan]] also points out that [[truth]] is similar to the [[real]]; it is impossible to articulate the whole [[truth]], and "[p]recisely because of this [[impossibility]], [[truth]] aspires to the real."<ref>{{TV}} p. 83</ref>
