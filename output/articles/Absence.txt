==Symbolic==
The [[symbolic order]] is characterized by a binary opposition between [[absence]] and [[absence|presence]].<ref>{{S4}} p.67-8</ref>

<blockquote>"In the symbolic order nothing exists except upon an assumed foundation of absence. Nothing exists except insofar as it does not exist."<ref>{{Ec}} p.392</ref></blockquote>

==Real==
This is a basic difference between the [[symbolic]] and the [[real]].

<blockquote>"There is no absence in the real.  There is only absence if you suggest that there may be a presence there where there isn't one."<ref>{{S2}} p.313</ref></blockquote>

==Linguistics==
As [[Roman Jakobson]] showed with his analysis of [[phoneme]]s, all [[linguistic]] phenomena may be entirely characterized in terms of the [[absence|presence]] or [[absence]] of certain distinctive features.

==Fort/Da==
[[Lacan]] sees the game of ''[[fort-da|fort!/da!]]'', which [[Freud]] describes in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', as a primitive phonemic opposition representing the child's entry into the [[symbolic order]].  The two sounds made by the [[development|child]], O/A, are "a pair of sounds modulated on presence and absence, and these sounds are related "to the presence and absence of persons and things."<ref>{{E}} p.65, 109, n.46</ref>

<!-- 
In the "fort-da" game, the [[child]] throws a cotton reel out of its cot in order to [[symbolic|symbolize]] the [[absence]] and [[presence]] of the [[mother]].  [[Symbolic|Symbolization begins when the [[child]] gets its first sense that something could be missing.
-->
==Word==
In the [[symbolic order]], [[absence]] has a [[existence|positive existence]] or [[absence|presence]].

<blockquote>"Through the word, which is already a presence made of absence, absence itself comes to be named."<ref>{{E}} p.65</ref></blockquote>

[[Lacan]] notes that the [[word]] is "a [[absence|presence]] made of [[absence]]" because:
# the [[symbol]] is used in the [[absence]] of the [[thing]] and
# [[signifiers]] only exist insofar as they are opposed to other [[signifiers]].<ref>{{E}} p.65</ref>

<!-- There is loss in the word.  [[Language]] can operate only by designating an [[object]] in its ''[[absence]]''.  [[Lacan]] argues that [[symbolization]] turns on the [[object]] as ''[[absence]]''.  -->

==Presence==
Because of the mutual implication of [[absence]] and [[absence|presence]] in the [[symbolic order]], [[absence]] can be said to have an equally positive [[existence]] in the [[symbolic]] as [[absence|presence]].  This is what allows [[Lacan]] to say that "the nothing" (''le rien'') is in itself an [[object]] (a [[partial object]]).<ref>{{S4}} p.184-5</ref>

==Phallus==
It is around the [[absence|presence]] and [[absence]] of the [[phallus]] that [[sexual difference]] is [[symbolically]] apprehended by the [[development|child]].  [[Sexual difference]] is apprehended by the [[child]] [[symbolic]]ally around the [[absence|presence]] and [[absence]] of the [[phallus]].
