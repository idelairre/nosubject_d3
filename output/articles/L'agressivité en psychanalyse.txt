This theoretical report was read at the Eleventh Congress of French-Speaking Psychoanalysts in Brussels, May 1948.

This theoretical report was read at the XI Conférence des Psychanalystes de Langue Française in Brussels, May 1948.

Its objective was to give [[psychoanalysis]] the status of a [[science]], by making [[aggressivity]] into a concept, and by proving that [[psychoanalysis|analytic experience]] could, in its own way, provide results capable of founding "a positive science." 

Lacan's conception of therapy is clear here; analytic technique is useful for setting into play the motivating forces of [[aggressivity]], in particular [[transference|negative transference]], the "inaugural knot of the analytic drama." 

In order to fight against the [[ego]] of [[méconnaissance|misconstruction]] (''[[méconnaissance]]''], "maieutics" must operate through a detour, "to induce a guided paranoia," and from there it is possible to work. 

These theses and the practice that they subte~d would give rise to many discussions and arguments. 

However, what remains specific about [[psychoanalysis|analytic experience]] is the fact that it takes place entirely in [[speech]]. 



The concept of [[aggressivity]] is constructed in relation to the [[mirror stage]] and the "[[paranoiac]] [[structure]] of the [[Ego]]." 

Only [[Oedipal]] [[identification]] with the [[father]] is pacifying and allows for social and cultural creativity.
