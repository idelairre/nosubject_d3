The [[Société Parisienne de Psychanalyse]] ('''SPP'''), founded in 1926, was active until the Second World War.  After losing many members in the conflict it resumed its activities in 1946.  Two years later Lacan become a member of the 'committee on teaching'.  

In 1953 it was proposed to found an Institute of Psychoanalysis.  Only physicieans were to be permitted to become members.  Understandably, psychoanalysts who were not physicians raised a protest against these proposals. There was a disagreement about analytic practice methods.

After a short period of time, [[Lacan]] resigned from his influential position as director and, together with a few friends, founded a new [[Société Française de Psychanalyse]] ([[SFP]]). ([[Lacan]] was a member of the [[SPP]] until 1953. [[Lacan]] (and many of his colleagues) left the [[SPP]] to form (a new group) the [[Société Française de Psychanalyse]] ([[SFP]]) ("[[French Psychoanalytic Society]]").)

The [[SPP]] was a member body of the [[International Psycho-Analytical Association]] ('''[[IPA]]''').
