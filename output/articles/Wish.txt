Freud placed increasing emphasis on a more precise definition of the wish, which became highly influential in the development of psychoanalytic theory. 


the wish was produced by unconscious mnemonic traces that were fixed indelibly by the earliest experiences of infantile satisfaction. 


The aim of the [[wish]] is to recreate that experience, following paths laid down by primary process thought, taking into account the "logic" of [[unconscious]] [[drive]]s to bypass [[censorship]]. 

The [[wish]] accomplishes this by being articulated in the [[language]] of the most profoundly [[cathexis|cathected]] ideas. 

This is what led Freud to define the dream as hallucinatory wish-fulfillment.
