<blockquote>Remote times have a great attractionsometimes mysteriously so--for the imagination. As often as mankind is dissatisfied with its present-and that happens often enough-it harks back to the past and hopes at last to win belief in the never forgotten dream of a Golden Age. Probably man still stands under the magic spell of his childhood, which a not unbiased memory presents to him as a time of unalloyed bliss.<ref>{{M&M}} Part. III, Section 1</ref></blockquote>
