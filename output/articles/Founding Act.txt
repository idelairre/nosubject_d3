=====Overview=====

[[Lacan]] founds the [[École Freudienne de Paris]] ([[EFP]]) on [[Chronology|June 21, 1964]].

On [[Chronology|June 21, 1964]], [[Lacan]] founds the [[École Freudienne de Paris]] ([[EFP]]).

----

According to the ''Acte de fondation'', the central aim of the [[EFP]] is to restore [[psychoanalysis]] to its true functin by making a rigorous critique of all the deviations and compromises which threaten its future development.

That function is inseparable from the [[training]] of [[analyst]]s who will be able to "reconquer" [[psychoanalysis]].

Membership implies active participation in the work of small study groups.

----

The [[EFP]] is organized on the basis of three sections, each of which is divided into three subsections: pure psychoanalysis (doctrine, training and supervision), applied psychoanalysis (doctrine of treatment, casuistics, psychiatric information) and a section devoted to surveying the Freudian field (continuous commentary on the psychoanalytic movement, articulation with related [[science]]s, [[ethics]] of [[psychoanalysis]]).

----

The solemn tone of the opening is well known:

<blockquote>"I hereby found the Ecole Française de Psychanalyse, by myself, as alone as I have ever been in my relation to the psychoanalytic cause."</blockquote>

The Ecole Française de Psychanalyse was soon to become, under the same initials, the Ecole Freudienne de Paris.

Very rapidly, people started talking of the [[Lacan]]ian [[School]], which defined itself by the haughty admission of its isolation, its conception of [[psychoanalysis]] as a [[cause]] to be defended, its faithfulness to a name -- [[Freud]] -- and to a body of texts, its appeal to disciples gathered in a [[School]] where they could militate in favor of the truth of a doctrine taught in [[seminar]]s, its crusade against the unfaithful, and its "movement of reconquest" for which [[Lacan]] needs "determined workers."

----

The organization of the [[school|école]] in three sections revealed the theoretical choices.

The first section, the most prestigious, was called "the section for ''pure psychoanalysis'', or praxis and doctrine of [[psychoanalysis]] properly speaking, which is nothing but ''didactic'' [[psychoanalysis]]."

It was the lively place of theoretical elaboration, which was not reserved for physicians alone.

Therapeutics and clinical practice were separated from it; they formed the section for ''applied psychoanalysis'' that was open to physicians even if they had not been psychoanalyzed.

----

As for the third section, it was linked to the [[seminar]]s and to the research of the E.P.H.E. and the E.N.S.; it was the section for ''taking inventory  of the Freudian field'' that studied the analytic movement and its publications, its articulation with related sciences, and, curiously, the [[ethics]] of [[psychoanalysis]].

It seemed to be open to whomever supported the [[Lacan]]ian principles.

The novelty and the open-mindedness of the enterprise are clear but the notion of a "pure psychoanalysis," so institutionalized and isolated, was soon going to create a problem.
