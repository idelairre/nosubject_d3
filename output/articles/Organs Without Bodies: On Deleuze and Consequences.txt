=====Book Description=====
[[Image:Organs.Without.Bodies.jpg|215px|right]]
The latest book by the Slovenian critic Slavoj Zizek takes the work of French philosopher Gilles Deleuze as the beginning of a dazzling inquiry into the realms of radical politics, philosophy, film (Hitchcock, ''Fight Club''), and psychoanalysis. Of ''Organs without Bodies'' Joan Copjec (Imagine There's No Woman) has written: "With all his ususal humor and invention, Zizek -- the acknowledged master of the 180 degree turn -- here takes a trip into "enemy" territory to deliver Deleuze of a marvelously rebellious child, one that seriously challenges Deleuze's other progeny with a surprising but convincing bid for succession. Those who thought Deleuze's forward march into the future would follow a straight path are forced to rethink their stance. From now on all readings of Deleuze will have to take a detour through this important -- even necessary -- book." Eric Santner (''On the Psychopathology of Everyday Life'') describes ''Organs without Bodies'' as offering "an entirely new degree of conceptual clarity and political urgency. Through his deep engagement with the logic of Deleuze's project, Zizek opens up new possibilities of thought beyond the terms of the current political debates on globalization, democratization, war on terror. Once again, Zizek has produced an utterly timely and radically untimely meditation." Recently profiled in ''The New Yorker'', and hailed by the ''Village Voice'' as "the giant of Ljubljana," Zizek is one of the most provocative and entertaining thinkers at work today.
