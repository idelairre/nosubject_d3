Paradoxically, one should claim that Lacan's abandonment of 'intersubjectivity' is strictly correlative to the focusing of attention on the enigma of the impenetrable desire of the Other, epitomized in the phrase Che vuoi? (What do you want?).  9


For Che vuoi?, see: J. Lacan, The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious, o.c., p. 312.


One should always bear in mind that the desire which is 'realized' (staged) in fantasy is not the subject's own, but the Other's desire. Fantasy, fantasmatic formation, is an answer to the enigma of Che vuoi?: 'You are saying this, but what is it that you effectively want by saying it?' This renders the subject's primordial, constitutive position. The original questioning of desire is not directly 'What do I want?,'
but 'What do others want from me?, What do they see in me?, What am I for the others?'
