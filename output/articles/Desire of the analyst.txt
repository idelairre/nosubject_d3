=====Jacques Lacan=====
The term "[[desire of the analyst]]" is ambiguous, and oscillates between two meanings in [[Lacan]]'s [[Jacques Lacan:Bibliography|work]].

=====Desire ''Attributed'' to the Analyst=====
In the first sense of the term, the "[[desire of the analyst]]" refers to the [[desire]] that the [[analysand]] ''attributes'' to the [[analyst]] (in addition to [[knowledge]]) in [[psychoanalytic treatment]], rather than the [[desire]] ''proper'' to the [[analyst]] (in his [[mind]] or [[psyche]]).

The [[analyst]] is therefore a "'''[[subject supposed to know|subject supposed to desire]]'''" (as well as a "[[subject supposed to know]]").

=====Desire ''Proper'' to the Analyst=====
In the second sense of the term, the "[[desire of the analyst]]" refers to the ''actual'' [[desire]] of the [[analyst]], which animates the [[analyst]] in the way he directs the [[treatment]].

=====Psychoanalytic Treatment=====
In [[psychoanalytic treatment]]

The task of the [[analyst]] throughout the [[treatment]] is to make it impossible for the [[analysand]] to be sure that he knows what the [[analyst]] wants from him; the [[analyst]] must make sure that his [[desire]] "remains an x" for the [[analysand]].<ref>{{S11}} p. 274</ref>

In this way the [[analyst]]'s supposed [[desire]] becomes the [[treatment|driving force]] of the [[analytic]] [[process]], since it keeps the [[analysand]] working, trying to discover what the [[analyst]] wants from him.

<blockquote>"The [[desire]] of the [[analyst]] is ultimately that which operates in [[psychoanalysis]]."<ref>{{Ec}} p. 854</ref></blockquote>

By presenting the [[analysand]] with an enigmatic [[desire]], the [[analyst]] occupies the position of the [[Other]], of whom the [[subject]] asks "'''[[Che vuoi?]]'''" ("What do you want from me?"), with the result that the [[subject]]'s [[fantasy|fundamental fantasy]] emerges in the [[transference]].

====Definition====
This is easier to define negatively than positively. 

It is certainly not a [[desire]] for the "impossible".<ref>{{S7}} p. 300</ref>

Nor is it a [[desire]] to "do good" or "to cure"; on the contrary, it is "a non-desire to cure."<ref>{{S7}} p. 218</ref>

====Identification====
It is not a [[desire]] that the [[analysand]] [[identification|identify]] with the [[analyst]]:

<blockquote>"The [[analyst]]'s [[desire]] . . . tends in a direction that is the exact opposite of [[identification]]."<ref>{{S11}} p. 274</ref></blockquote>

Rather than [[identification]], the [[analyst]] [[desire]]s that the [[analysand]]'s own unique [[truth]] emerge in the [[treatment]], a [[truth]] that is absolutely different to that of the [[analyst]]; the [[analyst]]'s [[desire]] is thus "a desire to obtain absolute difference."<ref>{{S11}} p. 276</ref>

====Ethics====
It is in the sense of a "'''[[Desire of the analyst|desire proper to the analyst]]'''" that [[Lacan]] wishes to locate the question of the [[analyst]]'s [[desire]] at the heart of the [[ethics]] of [[psychoanalysis]].

====Training====
How is it that the [[analyst]] comes to be guided by the [[desire]] which is proper to his function?

According to [[Lacan]], this can only occur by means of a [[training|training analysis]]. 

The essential requirement, the condition ''sine qua non'' for becoming an [[analyst]], is to undergo [[treatment|analytic treatment]] oneself. 

In the course of this [[treatment]] there will be a mutation in the economy of [[desire]] in the [[analyst|analyst-to-be]]; his [[desire]] will be [[structure|restructured]], [[structure|reorganized]].<ref>{{S8}} p. 221-2</ref>

Only if this happens will he be able to function properly as an [[analyst]].
