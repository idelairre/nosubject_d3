==One==
The space of pure [[death drive]] without [[desire]], between [[symbolic]] death and actual death. 

Lacan associates this space with an unconditional, insistent [[demand]], like the demand from the ghost of [[Hamlet]]'s father insisting that he be revenged. 
In [[popular culture]], this position is often taken up by the living dead (ghosts, vampires, zombies, etc.), by, as [[Slavoj Zizek]] puts it, "the [[fantasy]] of a person who does not want to stay dead but returns again and again to pose a threat to the living."<ref>(Looking Awry 22)</ref>
















==Two==

The [[subject]] can die not once, but twice.

We will suffer a [[biological]] [[death]] in which our [[bodies]] will fail and eventually disintegrate.
This is [[death]] in the [[real]], of our [[material]] [[self]].

We can also suffer a [[symbolic]] [[death]].
This is not the [[death]] of our actual [[bodies]].
This [[death]] entails the collapse of the [[symbolic]] [[order]] and the destruction of our [[subject]] [[position]]s.
We can suffer a [[death]] in which we are [[excluded]] from the [[Symbolic]] and no longer [[exist]] for the [[Other]].
This can occur in [[psychosis]].
We still [[exist]] in the [[Real]] but not in the [[Symbolic]].

The gap between the two deaths, Žižek argues, can be filled either by manifestations of the [[monstrous]] or the [[beautiful]]. 
For example, in ''[[Hamlet]]'', the play by [[William Shakespeare]], [[Hamlet]]'s [[father]] is [[dead]] in the [[Real]]. 
However, he persists as a terrifying and [[monstrous]] [[apparition]] because he was [[murder]]ed and thereby cheated of the chance to settle his [[Symbolic]] debts. 
Once that debt has been repaid, following [[Hamlet]]'s killing of his murderer, he is 'completely' [dead]]. 

Correspondingly, in ''[[Antigone]]'', the play by [[Sophocles]], [[Antigone]] suffers a [[Symbolic]] [[death]] before her [[Real]] [[death]] when she is [[excluded]] from the [[community]] for wanting to bury her traitorous brother. 
This destruction of her [[social]] [[identity]] instils her character with a [[sublime]] [[beauty]]. 
Ironically, [[Antigone]] enters the domain [[between the two deaths]] "precisely in order to prevent her brother's second death: to give him a proper funeral that will secure his eternalization."<ref>{{TTS}} p.170</ref> 
That is, she endures a [[Symbolic]] [[death]] in order that her brother, who has been refused proper burial rites, will not suffer a [[Symbolic]] [[death]] himself.
