=====Ferdinand de Saussure=====
[[Lacan]] takes the term "[[signifier]]" from the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].  

According to [[Saussure]], the [[signifier]] is the ''phonological'' element of the '''[[sign]]'''; not the actual sound itself, but the '''[[mental]] [[image]]''' of such a sound. 

In [[Saussure]]'s terms, the [[signifier]] is the "'''acoustic image'''" which signifies a [[signified]].<ref>[[Saussure|Saussure, Ferdinand de]]. (1916) ''[[Saussure|Course in General Linguistics]]'', ed. Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye, trans. Wade Baskin, Glasgow: Collins Fontana. p. 66-7</ref>

=====Primacy of the Signifier=====
Whereas [[Saussure]] argues that the [[signifier]] and the '''[[signified]]''' are ''mutually interdependent'', [[Lacan]] states that the [[signifier]] is ''primary'' and produces the '''[[signified]]'''. 

The [[signifier]] is first of all a [[meaning]]less [[material]] element in a ''closed differential [[system]]''; this "'''signifier without the signified'''" is called by [[Lacan]] the "'''pure signifier'''", though this is a question of logical rather than chronological precedence. 

<blockquote>"Every real signifier is, as such, a signifier that signifies nothing. The more the signifier signifies nothing, the more indestructible it is."<ref>{{S3}} p. 185</ref></blockquote>

=====The Subject and the Unconscious===== 
It is these [[meaning]]less indestructible [[signifier]]s which determine the [[subject]]; the effects of the [[signifier]] on the [[subject]] constitute the [[unconscious]], and hence also constitute the whole of the field of [[psychoanalysis]].

=====Basic Units of Language=====
Thus for [[Lacan]] [[language]] is not a [[system]] of [[sign]]s -- as it was for [[Saussure]] -- but a [[system]] of [[signifier]]s. 

[[Signifier]]s are the basic units of [[language]], and they are "subjected to the double condition of being reducible to ultimate differential elements and of combining according to the laws of a closed order."<ref>{{E}} p. 152</ref>

=====Differential Elements=====
By the phrase "reducible to ultimate differential elements," [[Lacan]] follows [[Saussure]] in asserting the fundamentally differential character of the [[signifier]]. 

[[Saussure]] states that in [[language]] there are no positive terms, only [[difference]]s.<ref>[[Saussure|Saussure, Ferdinand de]]. (1916) ''[[Saussure|Course in General Linguistics]]'', ed. Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye, trans. Wade Baskin, Glasgow: Collins Fontana. p. 120</ref>

=====Signifying Chains=====
By the phrase "combining according to the laws of a closed order," [[Lacan]] asserts that [[signifier]]s are combined in [[signifying chain]]s according to the [[law]]s of [[metonymy]].

=====Symbolic Order=====
The [[signifier]] is the constitutive unit of the [[symbolic]] [[order]] because it is integrally related with the concept of [[structure]].

<blockquote>"The notion of structure and that of signifier appear inseparable."<ref>{{S3}} p. 184</ref></blockquote>

The field of the [[signifier]] is the field of the [[Other]], which [[Lacan]] calls "the battery of signifiers."

=====That Which Represents a Subject for Another Signifier=====
[[Lacan]] defines a [[signifier]] as "that which represents a subject for another signifier," in opposition to the [[sign]], which "represents something for someone."<ref>{{S11}} p. 207</ref>

To be more precise, one [[signifier]] (called the [[master]] [[signifier]], and written '''[[Image:SS1.gif]]''') represents the [[subject]] for ''all other [[signifier]]s'' (written '''[[Image:SS2.gif]]''').

However, no [[signifier]] can ''[[signify]]'' the [[subject]].

=====Sigmund Freud=====
Although the term "[[signifier]]" is [[absent]] from [[Freud]]'s [[Sigmund Freud:Bibliography|work]], [[Lacan]]'s use of the term focuses attention on a recurrent theme in [[Freud]]'s [[Sigmund Freud:Bibliography|writings]]. 

[[Freud]]'s examples of [[psychoanalytic]] [[interpretation]]s constantly focus on purely formal [[linguistic]] features. 

Thus [[Lacan]]'s insistence that the [[analyst]] attend to the [[signifier]]s in the [[analysand]]'s [[speech]] is not really an innovation in [[technique]] but an attempt to theorize [[Freud]]'s own method in more rigorous terms.

=====Words and Non-Linguistic Things=====
While it is true that when [[Lacan]] talks about [[signifiers]] he is often referring to what others would call simply "[[word]]s," the two terms are not equivalent.

Not only can units of [[language]] smaller than [[word]]s ([[phoneme|morpheme]]s and [[phoneme]]s) or larger than [[word]]s (phrases and sentences) also function as [[signifier]]s, but so also can [[linguistic|non-linguistic]] things such as [[object]]s, relationships and [[symptom]]atic [[act]]s.<ref>{{S4}} p. 288</ref> 

=====Differential Nature of the Signifier=====
The single condition which characterizes something as a [[signifier]], for [[Lacan]], is that it is inscribed in a [[system]] in which it takes on value purely by virtue of its [[difference]] from the other elements in the [[system]].

=====Unstable Meaning=====
It is this differential nature of the [[signifier]] which means that it can never have a univocal or fixed [[meaning]];<ref>{{S4}} p. 289</ref> on the contrary, its [[meaning]] varies according to the [[position]] which it occupies in the [[structure]].
