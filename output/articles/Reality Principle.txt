==Sigmund Freud==
According to [[Freud]], the [[psyche]] is at first regulated entirely by the [[pleasure principle]], which seeks to experience [[satisfaction]] via a [[hallucinatory]] [[cathexis]] of a [[memory]] of [[time|prior]] [[satisfaction]].

However, the [[subject]] soon discovers that [[hallucination|hallucinating]] does not relieve his [[need]]s, and is thus forced "to form a conception of the real circumstances in the external world."<ref>[[Freud|Freud, Sigmund]]. "Formulations on the Two Principles of Mental Functioning." SE XII. 215. 1911. p.219.</ref>

A new "principle of mental functioning" is thus introduced (the "[[reality principle]]"), which modifies the [[pleasure principle]] and forces the [[subject]] to take more circuitous routes to [[satisfaction]].

Since, however, the ultimate aim of the [[reality principle]] is still the [[satisfaction]] of the [[drive]]s, it can be said that "the substitution of the reality principle for the pleasure principle implies no deposing of the pleasure principle, but only a safeguarding of it."<ref>[[Freud|Freud, Sigmund]]. "Formulations on the Two Principles of Mental Functioning." SE XII. 215. 1911. p.223</ref>


==Jacques Lacan==
From early on, [[Lacan]] is opposed to what he calls "a naive conception of the reality principle."<ref>[[Lacan, Jacques]]. "Some reflections on the ego." ''Int. J. Psycho-Anal.'' Vol 34. 1953. pp. 11</ref>

That is, he rejects any account of [[human]] [[development]] based on an unproblematic notion of "[[reality]]" as an objective and self-evident given.

He emphasizes [[Freud]]'s position that the [[reality principle]] is still ultimately in the serve of the [[pleasure principle]].

<blockquote>"The reality principle is a delayed action pleasrue principle."<ref>{{S2}} p.60</ref></blockquote>

[[Lacan]] thus challenges the idea that the [[subject]] has access to an infallible means of distinguishing between [[reality]] and [[fantasy]].

<blockquote>"[R]eality isn't jus tthere so that we bump our heads up against the false paths along which the functioning of the pleasure principle leads us.  In truth, we make reality out of pleasure."<ref>{{S7}} p.225</ref></blockquote>
