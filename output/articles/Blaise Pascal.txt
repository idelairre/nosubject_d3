<blockquote>Here I would refer to Blaise Pascal. Pascal's problem was also confrontation with modernity and modern science. His difficulty was that he wanted to remain an old, orthodox Christian in this new, modern age. It is interesting that his results were much more radical and interesting for us today than the results of superficial English liberal philosophers, who simply accepted modernity.<ref>{{Z}} "[[Articles by Slavoj Žižek|The One Measure of True Love Is: You Can Insult the Other]]."</ref></blockquote>
