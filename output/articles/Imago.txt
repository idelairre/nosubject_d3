==Psychoanalysis==
Originally introduced into [[psychoanalytic theory]] by [[Jung]] in 1911, the Latin term ''[[imago]]'' had already become standard in [[psychoanalytic]] [[:category:terms|terminology]] by the time [[Lacan]] began [[training]] as a [[psychoanalyst]] in the 1930s.

==Images==
The term is clearly related to the term "[[image]]", but it is meant to emphasize the subjective determination of the [[image]]; in other words, it includes feelings as well as a visual representation.

[[Imago]]s are specifically [[image]]s of other people.

However, they are not the product of purely personal experience but universal prototypes which may be actualized in anyone's [[psyche]].

[[Imago]]s act as stereotypes influencing the way the [[subject]] relates to other people, who are perceived through the lens of these various [[imago]]s.

==Complex==
The term "[[imago]]" occupies a central role in [[Lacan]]'s pre-1950 writings, where it is closely related to the term [[complex]].

In 1938, [[Lacan]] links each of the three [[family complex]]es to a specific [[imago]]: the [[weaning]] [[complex]] is liked to the [[imago]] of the maternal breast, the [[intrusion complex]] to the [[imago]] of the [[counterpart]], and the [[Oedipus complex]] to the [[imago]] of the [[father]].<ref>{{1938}}</ref>

==Psychology==
In 1946, [[Lacan]] argues that in formulating the concept of the [[imago]], [[psychoanalysis]] has provided [[psychology]] with a proper object of study and thus set [[psychology]] on a truly scientific footing.

<blockquote>"It is possible.. to designate in the imago the proper object of psychology, exactly to the same extent that Galileo's notion of the inert material poitn formed the basis of phsyics."<ref>{{Ec}} p. 188</ref></blockquote>

==Negative Effects==
Whereas for [[Jung]] and [[Klein]] [[imago]]s have equally positive and negative effects, in [[Lacan]]'s work they are weighted firmly towards the negative, being funamentally deceptive and disruptive elements.

[[Lacan]] speaks of the [[imago]] of the [[fragmented body]], and even [[autonomy|unified]] [[imago]]s such as the [[specular image]] are mere [[illusion]]s of [[lack|wholeness]] which introduce an underlying [[aggressivity]].

<blockquote>"The first effect of the imago which appears in the human being is an effect of subjective ''alienation''.<ref>{{Ec}} p. 181</ref></blockquote>

==Jacques Lacan==
After 1950 the term "[[imago]]" disappears almost entirely from [[Lacan]]'s [[theoretical]] [[:category:concepts|vocabulary]].

However, the basis ideas developed around the term in [[Lacan]]'s pre-1950 writings continue to play an important part in his thinking, being articulated around other terms, principally the term "[[image]]".
